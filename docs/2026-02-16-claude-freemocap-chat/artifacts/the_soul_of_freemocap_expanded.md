## Epigraph

> "The world that is is not the world that has to be. And even though the path is forever, the work is there. The handles are there. The shovels are there. We know how to pull. We know what the right direction is. We know how to dig the holes that need to be dug. And even if the distance looks insurmountable, there is a way to start."

# Part I: The Origin Story

## Chapter 1: The Path to the Tower

Jonathan Samir Matthis's path to FreeMoCap was not direct. It began in philosophy.

As an undergraduate, Jon studied philosophy of mind and philosophy of science—the deep questions about what consciousness is, what knowledge is, how we come to understand the world. He applied to philosophy graduate programs. He was rejected from all of them.

"By grace of God," he now says.

That rejection redirected him. He worked at an autism research facility and discovered that "data is cool"—that there was something deeply satisfying about the empirical investigation of reality. He applied to cognitive science programs, planning to study language. But the program he got into didn't have a language researcher. Looking through the faculty list, he found someone named Brett Fajin who studied "visual control of locomotion."

It sounded interesting enough. He said yes.

That accidental choice shaped the next two decades. Jon found himself studying how humans use vision to control movement—how we look at the ground to place our feet, how we navigate complex terrain, how the brain integrates visual information with motor commands. He got his PhD. He did a postdoc at University of Texas at Austin, studying people walking outdoors over rocks while wearing eye trackers and motion capture suits.

He built skills. He learned to hack together systems, to do basic computer vision, to work at the intersection of neuroscience, biomechanics, psychology, and engineering. His research got attention. He was described as having had a "meteoric rise."

By 2019, after nearly twenty years of education and training, he had achieved what he'd been working toward his entire adult life: a tenure-track faculty position at Northeastern University in Boston.

He arrived in summer 2019. The lab was built. The equipment was ordered. The research program was ready to launch.

"I had about a year of like, 'Boy, I sure did make it. And this is probably fine,'" he recalls.

Then came 2020.

## Chapter 2: The Breaking

March 2020: COVID-19 hits. Everyone is sent home. The lab sits empty.

The pandemic was disorienting for everyone. But for Jon, it became something more. It wasn't the virus that broke something. It was what the pandemic revealed about the institution he had spent his life trying to join.

### What He Saw

In faculty meetings, Jon watched administrators make calculations that turned his stomach.

> "A dean or some similar type of person said something to the effect that we should encourage our students to get master's degrees because master's students are the best income ratio—they pay full tuition but they don't require any resources. That kind of stuff is super gross."

The logic was naked: students as revenue sources, education as extraction. And it wasn't hidden. It was said out loud, in meetings, as if it were simply good business sense.

Then came the pressure to return to in-person teaching—before vaccines existed, "while people are still actively dying all over the place." The reason was obvious: the university needed the money. The physical campus was the product they were selling. If students could learn remotely, what were they paying for?

Safety was secondary. Revenue was primary.

Jon had been on the student side of academia his entire adult life—undergraduate, graduate student, postdoc. Those positions are temporary. You pass through. You don't see the other side of the conversations.

> "When you become a professor, all of a sudden you're on the other side of the fence. And so you start to see different conversations about it."

What he saw was an institution that talked about education and knowledge and human flourishing, but operated according to entirely different principles.

### The Blackmail

Then came the moment that crystallized everything.

Jon received a letter informing him that he was scheduled to teach in person. But there was a rider on the letter—an apparent concession to faculty concerns. It said that if he didn't feel comfortable teaching in person, he could opt out and teach remotely instead.

He opted out. Obviously. People were dying. Vaccines didn't exist yet. He would teach from home.

Then he received a second letter from his department chair. The policy had changed. If he opted out of in-person teaching, he couldn't come to campus for any reason—including to access his laboratory.

Think about what this means. Jon was a first-year research professor. His career depended on producing research. His research required his lab. And the university was telling him: teach in person during a pandemic, or lose access to everything you need to do your job.

> "As a first year research professor, that's basically saying, if you don't come in and teach in person against your will, we're going to tank your career."

It was blackmail. Politely worded, institutionally sanctioned blackmail.

His response was immediate and visceral:

> "Okay, well, fuck you. I'll build my own lab in my house with webcams."

### The $3 Million Webcam

But there was another moment—quieter, more devastating, more lasting.

Eventually Jon did teach remotely. He sat in his apartment, looking at his webcam, lecturing to a grid of rectangles on a screen. And he found himself counting.

How many students in this Zoom call? What's the tuition? What's the room and board?

He did the math.

> "I was speaking to a webcam that was worth $3 million a year in student debt."

Three million dollars. For a webcam lecture from a guy in his apartment.

But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was understanding *why* those students had taken on that debt.

> "The reason why they were going into that amount of debt was because of the promise of being able to learn from somebody like me... the fact that I was there doing the thing that I did was part of the recruitment that they used to bring these kids in and to convince them that it's worth it, which it fundamentally isn't and cannot be."

Jon was the product. His presence, his credentials, his research—these were the things the university used to justify charging $50,000 a year. Students went into life-altering debt because they believed that proximity to people like him was worth it.

And now he was looking at them through a webcam, knowing that it wasn't worth it, knowing that he was complicit in the extraction, knowing that his participation in the system was part of what made the system work.

> "More than anything else, that moment was the time when I was realizing finally... I truly cannot stay here. I cannot continue to be in this position."

## Chapter 3: The Grief

What followed was not just anger. Anger would have been easier. Anger has energy, direction, a target.

What Jon experienced was grief.

> "I was 35 years old. I had just gotten the faculty job that I had arguably been working towards my entire life. And then all of a sudden while I'm there, I'm like, oh wait, this place is completely morally bankrupt and diametrically opposed to my worldview. And I can't stay here."

Think about what that means. Nearly twenty years of work. A bachelor's degree, a PhD, a postdoc, the brutal competition of the academic job market. The sacrifices, the moves, the delayed life decisions, the relationships strained by the demands of the career. All of it aimed at one goal: a tenure-track position at a research university.

He got it. And then he realized he couldn't keep it.

> "Realizing that actually what I was doing had been kind of harnessed and captured by this institution that I frankly despised and was morally repugnant to me—was really, really damaging, really hurtful. Deeply traumatizing, I think."

This wasn't just disappointment. This was the collapse of a worldview, an identity, a life plan. Everything Jon thought he was working toward turned out to be something else entirely.

Jon has a clinical term for this experience: **moral harm**.

> "Moral harm is the specific kind of psychological trauma that occurs when you are forced to participate in an institution or a system that is morally repugnant to you in some way."

He uses this language deliberately. It's not just discomfort. It's not just disagreement. It's a form of psychological damage that occurs when you're trapped inside something you find morally intolerable—and when your participation makes you complicit.

This is the experience of the soldier who realizes the war is unjust. The employee who discovers the company is poisoning people. The true believer who learns the church is corrupt.

And it was the experience of a professor who realized that the university was not what it claimed to be—and that he had spent his life trying to join it.

## Chapter 4: The Discovery

But grief, if you survive it, can open space for something new.

During those months of "flailing around in the grief," Jon found himself spending more time with a piece of software called Blender.

Blender is a 3D animation and modeling program. It's the kind of software used to make animated films, video games, visual effects. Programs like it—Maya, 3ds Max, Cinema 4D—typically cost thousands of dollars per year in licensing fees.

Blender costs nothing. It's completely free. And it's not free because it's inferior. Blender is used in professional film production. It has won awards. It competes with software that costs orders of magnitude more.

How is this possible?

Blender is free and open source software. It's built by a community of thousands of contributors around the world. The source code is public. Anyone can see how it works, modify it, improve it. The Blender Foundation coordinates development, but the software belongs to everyone.

Jon had known about Blender before. But in those months of crisis, he started to really understand what it represented.

> "In those moments of losing faith in the academic system... seeing something like Blender and starting to understand the business model and the community model... that galvanization happened together. As I was losing faith in the one, I started to gain respect for the other."

He started to see a pattern. Here was a community that actually worked the way science claimed to work. Knowledge shared freely. Collaboration across boundaries. Building on each other's contributions. No gatekeepers. No paywalls. No artificial scarcity.

> "In those moments of losing faith in one institution, you kind of go back to try to figure out what your own morality was and what your own values are... recognizing [Blender] as another organism, a different institution and a different communal structure that felt like it was more aligned."

The realization crystallized into a sentence he's repeated for years since:

> "The open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be."

Science *claims* to be about collaboration, openness, shared knowledge, building on previous work for the common good. Scientists *talk* about standing on the shoulders of giants.

But in practice? Publications locked behind paywalls. Data hoarded for competitive advantage. Research programs siloed by funding structures and institutional rivalries. Careers built on outcompeting peers rather than collaborating with them.

> "We pretend as scientists that we are doing that, that we're working in this big sort of global collaborative endeavor, but it's not. Practically speaking, you're just not really able to do it."

The open source community, by contrast, actually operates according to the principles that science only claims. The code is public. The development is transparent. The work builds on itself. Anyone can contribute. Anyone can benefit.

This wasn't just an alternative career path. It was an alternative model for how knowledge work could be organized.

# Part II: The Response

## Chapter 5: Lift Where You Stand

Around the same time as the institutional betrayals, another catalyst emerged.

May 2020: George Floyd is murdered by Minneapolis police. Protests erupt across the country and around the world. A moment of national reckoning about race, power, and justice.

Jon was watching. And he was asking himself questions.

> "Also happened to coincide with the start of the George Floyd protests, at which point I think we all kind of started to ask these kind of questions about whether or not we were really adequately using our positions of power to do the most good for the most people."

He had just realized that the institution he'd devoted his life to was morally bankrupt. Now he was watching a society-wide conversation about power, complicity, and responsibility. The question wasn't just "what's wrong with this system?" It was "what am I going to do about it?"

In that moment, Jon encountered a concept that became central to his approach:

> "I encountered a very powerful concept of **lift where you stand**. The idea is that when you encounter a problem or inequity that causes you some moral harm, you don't just turn around and drop everything that you've done in the hopes of going off to join Greenpeace or something like that."

This is a crucial insight. When people experience moral awakening—when they realize that something about their world is deeply wrong—there's a temptation toward dramatic gesture. Quit everything. Burn it down. Start over in a completely different domain.

But that impulse, however understandable, often leads nowhere. You leave behind all the skills, knowledge, and connections you've built. You arrive in the new domain as a novice. And the original problem remains unsolved.

Jon had spent twenty years learning how to study human movement, how to build experimental systems, how to work at the intersection of neuroscience and technology. That expertise was real. It had value. Throwing it away wouldn't help anyone.

> "I don't know shit about the climate. I know about how to make laser skeletons."

"Laser skeletons"—his shorthand for the kind of motion capture research he does. Tracking human bodies in 3D space. Understanding how people move.

It's a specific skill set. A narrow expertise. Not obviously connected to the great injustices of the world.

But the concept of "lift where you stand" offers a different approach:

> "So the concept of lift where you stand is: when you're having a problem, what you do is you look around where you're standing, you find something that looks like a handle, you grab it and you pull as hard as you can in what feels like the right direction."

Don't abandon your position. Don't pretend you're someone else. Look at where you actually are, what you actually know, what you can actually do. Find a point of leverage. And pull.

This crystallized into a key realization:

> "On the list of global inequities, maybe motion capture is not particularly high, but what IS high is inaccessibility of science and technology."

Motion capture systems typically cost tens of thousands of dollars. The cheapest professional options run around $10,000. High-end systems used in film production cost much more. This means that motion capture—the ability to precisely record and analyze human movement—is available only to institutions with substantial resources.

Is that the biggest injustice in the world? Obviously not. But it's connected to something bigger: the way scientific tools and technical knowledge are locked behind barriers of money and institutional access.

And Jon knew how to build motion capture systems. That was his handle. That was where he could pull.

## Chapter 6: The Deliberate Flip to Cheap

Before the crisis, Jon had been working on markerless motion capture as a side project. The idea: use computer vision and machine learning to track human bodies without the reflective markers that traditional systems require. Just cameras and software.

The original plan was to develop the system using GoPro cameras—moderately expensive, high quality—and then scale up to professional research-grade cameras. The standard trajectory: get it working with decent equipment, then make it better.

But around the time of the George Floyd protests, Jon made a strategic pivot that would define the project:

> "What if we just pushed in the other direction and what if instead of pushing it towards research grade stuff, I push it towards the most garbage cameras you can possibly get on the assumption that if it works for the cheap cameras, it will also work for the good cameras, but not necessarily the other way around."

This is a crucial decision. It's not just a technical choice. It's a statement about who the technology is for.

If you build for expensive cameras first, you create something that works for people who can afford expensive cameras. Maybe you eventually make a cheaper version. Maybe you don't.

If you build for garbage cameras first, you create something that works for everyone. The physics doesn't care how much your webcam cost. If the algorithms can handle the noise and distortion of a $10 camera, they'll work even better with a $500 camera.

The result: a motion capture system that costs $30. Three garbage webcams. Ten dollars each.

> "That is a $30 motion capture system recorded in 11 minutes or less."

This wasn't making do with less. This was deliberately choosing the constraints that would force the technology to be maximally accessible.

## Chapter 7: Not a Huff

Given everything Jon had realized about the university, the natural impulse might be to quit. Storm out. Make a statement.

> "There was a part of me that kind of wanted—when you want to stomp out the door and be in a huff or whatever—but that's not actually a strategic move because you're leaving a lot of resources on the table and you don't have anything to step into."

This is the discipline of long-term thinking. Moral clarity doesn't require immediate action. In fact, immediate dramatic action often undermines long-term goals.

Jon had signed a contract to be at Northeastern for several years. He had access to resources, salary, equipment, students. He had time—time that was paid for, time that he could direct toward whatever he chose to work on.

Tenure is a two-way street. The university evaluates you, but you also evaluate the university. Jon had already decided this institution wasn't worthy of his long-term commitment. He wouldn't pursue tenure. He wouldn't play the game of publishing papers to please committees.

But he also wouldn't leave prematurely. He would use what the position offered to build something better.

> "It was sort of like a prefigurative kind of approach of trying to—what if this institution is not what I think it should be, what is the thing that should be? What would allow me to continue to be the kind of scientist and researcher and mentor and teacher and all that I wanted to be without having to be attached to an institution that I couldn't morally stomach."

The term "prefigurative" comes from political theory. It means building the future you want within the shell of the present. Not waiting for revolution. Not demanding that the world change first. Creating, now, the structures and practices and relationships that embody your values—even while still embedded in systems that violate them.

Jon would remain a professor. He would teach classes. He would draw a salary. But his real work would be building the alternative.

> "FreeMoCap and the FreeMoCap Foundation is kind of the answer to that question."

## Chapter 8: The Pivot—Up vs. Down

The critical insight was about direction.

Academic careers are structured as ladders. You climb. Each rung is achieved by pleasing the people above you. Undergraduates please professors to get recommendations. Graduate students please advisors to get degrees. Postdocs please PIs to get jobs. Junior faculty please senior faculty to get tenure.

At every stage, the incentive is the same: serve up. Make the people above you happy. Outperform the people beside you. Climb.

> "A lot of the effort that I was putting in, almost a very big percentage of the effort I was putting into the world, was made in the service of the people who were above me on the hierarchy and trying to do the things that they wanted me to do so that I could outperform my peers and be allowed to stay in the warm, happy, shining tower."

Jon had spent twenty years in this mode. Working to please advisors, committees, reviewers, editors, deans. Trying to outcompete peers for positions, grants, publications. All directed upward in the hierarchy.

And where had it led? To a position in an institution he despised, doing work that served to extract money from students who couldn't afford it.

The shift was simple to state and difficult to execute:

> "One of the big brain shifts that happened was deciding to just stop doing that and to just stop caring or considering what I was being asked to do by people above me in the hierarchy and start asking instead what I could do to support people who were at or below me in that same hierarchy."

Stop serving up. Start serving down.

This wasn't abandoning ambition. It was redirecting it. Instead of asking "what do I need to do to get tenure?" the question became "what could I build that would actually help people?"

The people above Jon in the hierarchy wanted publications, grants, prestige, metrics. The people below—students, aspiring researchers, independent creators without institutional resources—wanted tools that worked and knowledge they could actually use.

Those wants pointed in different directions. Jon chose a direction.

## Chapter 9: What Academia Actually Is

To understand the choice Jon made, you have to understand his analysis of what academia has become.

The *myth* of academia is familiar. Universities as communities of scholars, seeking truth, advancing knowledge, educating the next generation. Professors as mentors, researchers as explorers, students as apprentices in the life of the mind.

The *reality*, as Jon experienced it, is different.

> "Most of the research that gets done really shouldn't be done. It's not good research. It's just smart research. It's strategically the right move to get the publication, to get the grants, to get the job, to get the tenure."

Note the distinction: not *good* research, but *smart* research. Research that advances careers. Research that can be published. Research that grants will fund. Whether it actually advances human knowledge or benefits anyone is secondary.

> "The nature of the institutions that sort of house it and the realities of the hyper competitive structures of society that we've sort of grown for ourselves are that you're not really able to do it in a way that really benefits anybody outside of the club."

The structure produces the behavior. When resources are scarce, competition is fierce, and careers depend on metrics, people optimize for metrics. They do research that generates publications, whether or not that research matters. They teach in ways that generate good evaluations, whether or not students learn. They build empires of grants and graduate students, whether or not those empires produce anything of value.

And the whole structure is predicated on a mathematical impossibility:

> "You're supposed to produce like, you know, more than two people who are also trying to get tenure at other schools, which is sort of the definition of a Ponzi scheme."

Each professor trains multiple PhD students who are trying to become professors. But the number of professor positions isn't growing at the same rate. The math doesn't work. Most of those PhD students will not become professors, no matter how good they are, no matter how hard they work.

The system requires this failure. It runs on the labor of people who will be discarded. And everyone inside the system knows this, even as they continue to recruit new entrants.

Even "outreach"—the supposedly altruistic effort to share science with the public—is corrupted by the logic of the system:

> "When you see scientists doing outreach, it's often this kind of just like side thought, like, I'm going to go to a high school, show them how cool it is to be super highly educated and then just leave and then hope that they're inspired enough to follow in your path, out compete their peers, and then maybe they someday can get into that shining tower at the top of the hill."

The message isn't "here's knowledge that will help you." It's "isn't this cool? Maybe you can be like me someday—if you're lucky enough to win the competition."

This is the system Jon had spent twenty years climbing into. And this is the system he decided he couldn't serve.

# Part III: The Philosophy

## Chapter 10: What FreeMoCap Actually Is

FreeMoCap is a free, open-source markerless motion capture system.

In technical terms: it uses computer vision and machine learning to track human bodies in 3D space without requiring special markers or suits. You point some webcams at a person, record them moving, and the software produces a 3D skeleton—a digital representation of their body position over time.

This technology has existed in expensive, proprietary forms for years. Professional motion capture systems cost tens of thousands of dollars. They're used in film production (for CGI characters), in video game development (for character animation), in biomechanics research (for studying how people move), in clinical settings (for rehabilitation and assessment).

FreeMoCap does similar things with $10 webcams and free software.

But that technical description misses the point. FreeMoCap isn't just a motion capture system. It's an embodiment of a philosophy.

> "We want indie game designers and animators to use the same tool to add motion capture assets to their zero budget art project that I am using for my federally funded scientific research program."

Same tool. The indie animator in their bedroom gets the same technology as the professor with grant funding. The high school student gets the same technology as the professional studio. The researcher in Nigeria gets the same technology as the researcher at MIT.

This is not charity. It's not "providing access to the less fortunate." It's the assertion that tools should just work, for everyone, without gatekeepers:

> "I don't want to tell you what you should care about. I'd rather just give you useful tools and let you do what you want to do with it."

Jon doesn't want to direct people's curiosity. He wants to remove the barriers that prevent them from following their own curiosity wherever it leads.

And there's an educational dimension—but not education in the traditional sense:

> "FreeMoCap wants to be designed kind of as a tool that teaches you things about how it works. And every individual person is going to be pulled in a different direction and drawn to different parts of the thing."

The tool doesn't lecture. It doesn't give lessons and quizzes. But its design makes its own workings visible. Use it long enough, and you start to understand computer vision, 3D geometry, coordinate systems, calibration. Not because anyone is teaching you, but because the understanding emerges from engagement.

## Chapter 11: The Gatekeeping Instinct

One anecdote captures the opposition Jon faces—not from obvious enemies, but from well-meaning people within his own world:

> "There is a reaction that I have had more than once when I talked about the software to people, which is, 'You should be careful not to make it too easy to use, otherwise the students won't understand what's going on in there.' And it's like insane to me to think that."

Read that again. People are warning Jon that his software might be *too accessible*. That making it easy to use might somehow harm students by preventing them from understanding it.

This is the gatekeeping instinct dressed up as pedagogical concern. The implicit assumption: understanding is scarce, precious, earned through suffering. If we make things too easy, people might get access without "deserving" it.

Jon rejects this completely. Making a tool easy to use doesn't prevent understanding—it enables it. When you're not wrestling with installation problems and obscure error messages, you can actually explore what the tool does. When the barrier to entry is low, more people enter, and some of them go deep.

The gatekeeping instinct is pervasive in academia. It manifests as:
- Journals locked behind paywalls
- Software requiring expensive licenses
- Knowledge expressed in unnecessarily obscure jargon
- Curricula designed as obstacle courses
- Credentials required for access to further credentials

Every barrier serves a dual purpose: it restricts access, and it makes those who pass feel special. The scarcity is manufactured, but the prestige is real.

FreeMoCap is designed to route around this. No credentials required. No payment required. No institutional affiliation required. Just download it and use it.

## Chapter 12: The Techno-Capitalist Critique

Jon's critique extends beyond academia to the broader technology landscape.

> "It has come from the techno capitalist corpo hegemony that is the source of so much of the problems and harm in our society."

"Techno capitalist corpo hegemony" is a phrase worth unpacking. It points to the interlocking system of technology companies, venture capital, platform monopolies, and the ideology that serves them—the assumption that technological progress is identical to corporate profit, that disruption serves human welfare, that the market allocates technological benefits fairly.

> "Anytime there's a new technology that comes around, the techno capitalists or just the corporate capitalists basically try to rush to the new domain and start building moats around it so that they can sequester it and then use their access to that thing as a way to exploit the world at large."

The pattern is consistent. A new technology emerges. Companies race to capture it. They build moats—patents, proprietary standards, network effects, regulatory capture. Once the moat is built, they extract rent. Access to the technology becomes access to a toll booth.

This has happened with operating systems, with social networks, with cloud computing, with search. And it's happening now with artificial intelligence.

> "That is the true core of capitalism—to exploit disparities between yourself and others to extract resources from them."

This is a stark framing. Not "capitalism creates value through voluntary exchange." Not "markets coordinate information efficiently." The core function, in Jon's view, is exploitation of disparity. If you have something others need and can't get elsewhere, you can extract from them. Capitalism is the systematic organization of this extraction.

## Chapter 13: AI as Potential Liberation

But Jon's view of technology is not simply critical. He sees potential for liberation—specifically in artificial intelligence.

> "AI used properly is something that has the ability to be a transformatively liberative tool and one that has the potential to make every single human person that learns how to use it and learns how to wield it a more powerful and capable version of yourself."

This might seem to contradict the critique of techno-capitalism. After all, the current AI boom is driven by exactly the corporations Jon criticizes. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic—these are well-funded entities with commercial interests.

But Jon draws a distinction between the technology and its current institutional capture:

> "They're trying to build moats around the Moat Blaster 9000. Like, it is a tool that will teach you how it works and it will show you everything there is to know about itself. And they're trying to corral it and control it... and it's kind of just not working in the way that they would expect."

The metaphor is vivid: a "Moat Blaster 9000" that destroys moats. AI is uniquely resistant to capture because of what it is. A language model can explain how language models work. A coding assistant can help you build your own coding assistant. The technology undermines the barriers that would restrict it.

This doesn't mean AI can't be used for harm, or that corporate AI isn't dangerous. It means that AI has unusual properties that make it potentially democratizing in ways that previous technologies weren't.

## Chapter 14: Seizing the Means

The vision comes into focus:

> "A lot of my focus has really shifted towards the potential of technology as a liberatory tool. And specifically how I think if enough people in the world gained the kind of technical competency necessary to really engage in the open source community, then we can literally seize back the means of production."

"Seize the means of production" is of course a Marxist phrase. But Jon isn't talking about factories or farms. He's talking about the means of *technological* production—the ability to create software, to build systems, to shape the digital infrastructure that increasingly shapes our lives.

> "Free people of having to live their entire lives attached and managed by corporations. And now at this point in history, governments, because we are entering into the AI era."

The stakes have risen. In 2020, the concern was corporations using technology to extract and control. Now, in 2026, governments are entering the game. AI systems will be used for surveillance, for administration, for enforcement. The question of who controls these systems becomes a question of who controls society.

> "FreeMoCap specifically and then free open source software in general, as a way of teaching people the skill sets that they would need in order to be able to claw back our culture and our society and our technology from these corporate entities that have shown themselves not to be worthy of the power that they have captured and gathered."

FreeMoCap is not just a motion capture system. It's a gateway—a point of entry into technical literacy, into the open source community, into the skills and culture of building technology rather than merely consuming it.

# Part IV: The Transition

## Chapter 15: The Last Year

As of 2026, Jon is in his final year at Northeastern University.

The prefigurative period is ending. For years, he used the resources of the institution—salary, time, equipment, legitimacy—to build the alternative. Now the alternative must stand on its own.

> "Right now in the transition, we're moving from—this is my last year [at Northeastern]. So I'm transitioning into the world of trying to figure out how it is possible to support yourself, a lab scale group of people, while building free software that does not charge subscription fees... how do you survive in the world when you're not going to be attached to a big research institution or a big corporation."

This is not a rhetorical question. It's an existential one. Jon is trying to solve the fundamental problem of open source sustainability: how do people who build things that are given away freely support themselves?

The problem is structural. In a market economy, you exchange goods or services for money. But free software, by definition, is given away. It's not scarce. It can't command a market price in the traditional sense.

There are models: donations, sponsorships, grants, consulting, paid support. But none of them are easy. Many open source projects have collapsed when their maintainers burned out or couldn't pay their bills. The history of free software is littered with abandoned projects and exhausted developers.

Jon is trying to find a path—not just for himself, but as a proof of concept.

## Chapter 16: What Winning Looks Like

Jon describes winning at three levels:

**Immediate / Survival:**
> "That would be winning if we can get a stable position there."

A small team—"me and two or three other people"—sustaining themselves while building free software. Not getting rich. Not achieving fame. Just surviving while doing the work.

This is the minimum viable victory: demonstrate that it's possible to live this way.

**Medium-Term / Case Study:**
> "The dream is that if I can figure out that one case study of how to support myself as a researcher and educator and mentor and software developer by building a tool like FreeMoCap, then that could potentially serve as a model that other people start to do."

If Jon succeeds, his success becomes a template. Other researchers trapped in institutions they despise can see that there's a way out. Other developers building tools that should be free can see that it's possible to sustain that work.

> "FreeMoCap could serve as a conduit and umbrella and support system for people who are trying to achieve their own sense of independence and escape."

The FreeMoCap Foundation could become not just a project, but an infrastructure—a way for others to do similar work without having to solve all the structural problems from scratch.

**Long-Term / Catalytic:**
> "Motion capture is not—in the long list of inequities and wrongs in the universe, inaccessibility of markerless motion capture is pretty low on the list, but it is on the list. And if we can sort of solve that tiny inequity, then it might serve as a model of how to solve bigger ones."

Jon is clear-eyed about the relative importance of motion capture. It's not hunger or war or climate change. But that's the point of "lift where you stand"—you work with what you have, where you are.

> "If the tool itself can serve as an inroad to teaching a wider set of people the skill sets necessary to work in the same direction, then it might be a catalytical project that could start as a seed and wind up extending and touching things beyond its particular scope and domain."

The vision: FreeMoCap as one instance of a pattern. A proof that another way is possible. A gateway drug to technical literacy and open source participation. A seed that grows into something larger.

# Part V: The Soul

## Chapter 17: What Someone Should Feel

When asked what he wants someone to feel when they successfully capture their first skeleton, Jon gives an answer that reveals the emotional core of the project.

**For users—especially young people or those who feel like technological outsiders:**

> "I want them to kind of think, 'Oh, I can do this. I can make this happen. I can set it up. And even if I don't understand everything that I'm seeing, there's little glimmers of things that I can start to understand. I can feel the understandings beginning. And I can feel the opportunities to pull threads.'"

"I can do this." That's the feeling. Not "this is being done to me." Not "this is happening through some incomprehensible magic." But: I made this happen. I set this up. I did it.

And then: "I can feel the understandings beginning." The tool is designed to be not just usable but comprehensible. There are threads to pull. There are doors to open. The first success is not an endpoint but an invitation.

**For people looking at the project from outside:**

> "I want people to see FreeMoCap and the FreeMoCap Foundation as an example of—look. Look at what we can make. Look at what you can build if you just step away from the standard path. Look at what we have the capacity to do."

This is for the observers, the skeptics, the people who assume that serious technology requires serious resources. Look what's possible when you refuse those assumptions.

> "We can build tools that perform in the ways that they should, that just work and don't try to take anything from you and just give to you. It is possible to build and give gifts freely given to the world without extracting resources as a result."

Tools that "just work and don't try to take anything from you." This is a vision of technology without extraction. Without dark patterns. Without surveillance. Without monetization of attention. Just: here is a thing that does what it claims to do. Use it. It's yours.

**The deepest message:**

> "I want to be able to show that that's a world you can live in, that that's a thing that you can do, and that we collectively as a group have the options of building things the way that they should be."

It's possible. That's the message. This isn't utopian fantasy. It's an existence proof. The world can be different. We can build differently. And this is what it looks like.

> "The world that is is not the world that has to be."

## Chapter 18: The Dots on the Map

There's a map. A world map with dots. Each dot is someone who has used FreeMoCap.

As of 2026, there are approximately 10,000 users across more than 115 countries.

Jon talks about this map with undisguised emotion:

> "I see you. I see you there in the Faroe Islands. I see you doing your thing... Look at you in Oslo and Stockholm... Look at you in India. Who's this guy? Who are you? That's what I want to know."

> "Thanks for not unchecking the box, guys. I like to see the dots. It really, truly, truly keeps me going to just kind of like, every so often, log and be like, holy shit. You guys are using it."

This is not vanity metrics. This is not growth hacking. This is: someone in the Faroe Islands is building skeletons with this software I made. Someone in Nigeria. Someone in a high school in Ohio. Someone in their garage.

The dots are evidence that it works. Not just technically—that the software runs—but socially. That the thing Jon is trying to do is actually happening. People are using the tools. People are learning. The gift is being received.

## Chapter 19: Staying Sane

Finally, there's the personal dimension.

> "FreeMoCap is absolutely part of that [managing moral harm]. It's sort of like, I have to have something that I'm working towards and building towards, and I have to feel like I'm somehow pulling in the right direction in order to feel sane. And so FreeMoCap is sort of like the embodiment of that effort."

Remember: Jon experienced moral harm. The trauma of realizing that the institution he'd devoted his life to was morally bankrupt. That his work had been harnessed in service of something he despised.

FreeMoCap is not just a project. It's how he stays functional. It's how he transforms grief into action.

> "Specifically utilizing the specific skill sets and understandings that I have to try to feel like I'm, you know, to get back to that feeling I had of being attached to a good vehicle and pulling the world in a good direction."

"Attached to a good vehicle." There's something here about meaning—about the human need to feel that your work matters, that your efforts contribute to something worthwhile, that the thing you're part of is pulling in the right direction.

Academia, for Jon, turned out not to be a good vehicle. FreeMoCap is his attempt to build one.

# Part VI: Theoretical Mapping

## Chapter 20: Jon's Language and Political Theory

An interesting feature of Jon's speech is how closely it maps to formal political and social theory—often without using the academic terminology.

| Theoretical Concept | Jon's Natural Language |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Gramsci's hegemony | "techno capitalist corpo hegemony" |
| Counter-hegemony / class consciousness | "seize back the means of production" |
| Freire's conscientização (critical consciousness) | "I can feel the understandings beginning" |
| Illich's convivial tools | "tools that just work and don't try to take anything from you" |
| Prefigurative politics | "prefigurative approach" (uses this exact term) |
| Moral injury / institutional betrayal | "moral harm" (uses this clinical term) |
| Banking model of education | critique of "outcompete your peers" model |
| War of position | strategic use of institutional resources while building alternative |
| Praxis / situated action | "lift where you stand" - find a handle, pull in the right direction |

This suggests that the theoretical frameworks are not imposed from outside—they map onto something real in Jon's thinking and experience. The theory can deepen and contextualize the analysis, but the analysis stands on its own.

For future documents that integrate this material with formal theory: lead with Jon's language. Let the theory serve as annotation, not foundation.

# Part VIII: Key Quotations

## On Academia

> "None of this is okay. None of the general structure of academia education is morally defensible at almost any level."

> "Most of the research that gets done really shouldn't be done. It's not good research. It's just smart research."

> "You're supposed to produce more than two people who are also trying to get tenure at other schools, which is sort of the definition of a Ponzi scheme."

> "The open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be."

> "Speaking to a webcam that was worth $3 million a year in student debt."

> "You should be careful not to make it too easy to use, otherwise the students won't understand what's going on in there."—advice Jon considers "insane"

## On the Response

> "Okay, well, fuck you. I'll build my own lab in my house with webcams."

> "Lift where you stand: when you're having a problem, what you do is you look around where you're standing, you find something that looks like a handle, you grab it and you pull as hard as you can in what feels like the right direction."

> "I don't know shit about the climate. I know about how to make laser skeletons."

> "On the list of global inequities, maybe motion capture is not particularly high, but what IS high is inaccessibility of science and technology."

> "What if we just pushed in the other direction... towards the most garbage cameras you can possibly get."

> "Stop caring or considering what I was being asked to do by people above me in the hierarchy and start asking instead what I could do to support people who were at or below me in that same hierarchy."

> "It was sort of like a prefigurative kind of approach."

## On Technology and Capitalism

> "The techno capitalist corpo hegemony that is the source of so much of the problems and harm in our society."

> "The true core of capitalism is to exploit disparities between yourself and others to extract resources from them."

> "They're trying to build moats around the Moat Blaster 9000."

## On Liberation

> "We can literally seize back the means of production."

> "Claw back our culture and our society and our technology from these corporate entities that have shown themselves not to be worthy of the power that they have captured and gathered."

> "AI used properly is something that has the ability to be a transformatively liberative tool."

## On FreeMoCap

> "We want indie game designers and animators to use the same tool to add motion capture assets to their zero budget art project that I am using for my federally funded scientific research program."

> "I don't want to tell you what you should care about. I'd rather just give you useful tools and let you do what you want to do with it."

> "FreeMoCap wants to be designed kind of as a tool that teaches you things about how it works."

## On What It's For

> "I can do this. I can make this happen... I can feel the understandings beginning."

> "Look at what we can make. Look at what you can build if you just step away from the standard path."

> "It is possible to build and give gifts freely given to the world without extracting resources."

> "The world that is is not the world that has to be."

## On Staying Sane

> "I have to have something that I'm working towards and building towards, and I have to feel like I'm somehow pulling in the right direction in order to feel sane."

> "I see you there in the Faroe Islands... Thanks for not unchecking the box, guys. I like to see the dots. It really, truly, truly keeps me going."

> "Even though the path is forever, the work is there. The handles are there. The shovels are there."

# Closing

> "Even though the path is forever, the work is there. The handles are there. The shovels are there. We know how to pull. We know what the right direction is. We know how to dig the holes that need to be dug. And even if the distance looks insurmountable, there is a way to start."
