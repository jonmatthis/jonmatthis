### Chunk 1 [00:00:00 - 00:03:23]

**[00:00:00]** Doing your thing. This is up. Give myself that to look at. Then I come back here, I do this charcoal dance. I used to just leave it statically on the screen, but I think this gives it better calibration and moving it up and down I think will give it better lens distortion estimations.

**[00:00:22]** Okay. And I'm going to clap for the audio sync and then I'm gonna stand in a pose to give a nice sort of clean view for the rigging, rigify, blender rigging thing. Okay. Then I get my head into like the weird energy of like pitching sincerely a thing that you believe and care about to a bunch of cameras alone in an apartment. Okay.

**[00:00:48]** And then do the Wayne's World countdown. And five, four, three.

**[00:00:57]** Hello, my name is Jonathan Samir Mathis and this is freemocap. We're building a free open source markerless motion capture system designed to provide research quality recordings of 3D movement to everyone for free. The sheer volume of world shaking technologies and computational techniques that that went into the generation of this animation is staggering. These technologies will shape the future of our society. And yet, even though many of these techniques are already free and open source, there is a massive technical barrier between the average person and the ability to use these tools for their own needs, whatever those may be.

**[00:01:38]** The Free mocap project will create a system that makes those technologies a available, accessible and transparent to the communities of people who stand to benefit from them. I'm a research professor who studies neuroscience of full body human movement in natural environments. And the goal is to make a tool that serves both my needs as a professional research scientist while remaining intuitively usable to a 13 year old with no technical training and no outside assistance. We, we want indie game designers and animators to use the same tool to add motion capture assets to their zero budget art project that I am using for my federally funded scientific research program. We believe that Free MOCAP can serve to build practical educational bridges between the wide range of communities that might benefit from the ability to accurately record, reconstruct and measure human movement.

**[00:02:34]** Not just scientists, not just animators and game designers, but athletes, coaches, dancers, performers, anyone who might have a reason to record human movement. And everyone has a reason to record human movement. And we want to help them do it. Thank you.

**[00:02:59]** Okay. All right. That was good. That was good. That was good.

**[00:03:02]** That was good. Okay. Hope it calibrates. Okay. The vanilla.

**[00:03:06]** A pose just for fun. Another clap because I know it's like the time is weird. Another charuko dance. This is not necessary, but it's good. To have a backup in case the first one fails.

**[00:03:20]** What am I forgetting? I think that's it. God help us all.
