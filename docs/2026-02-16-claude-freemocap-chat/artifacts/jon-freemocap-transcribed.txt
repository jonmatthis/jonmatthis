Some other things, I think, to talk about from your questions. You asked, what do I want someone to feel when they successfully capture their first set skeleton That's an interesting question. And I think there's kind of multiple ways to think about that. I think for some people, like for young people or people from the technological outside who don't feel connected to technology, who don't sort of feel themselves as someone who can use technology fluently, who kind of feel like their technology is being pushed on top of them rather than something that they can harness and choose for themselves, whoever that might be. I want them to kind of think of like, oh, I can do this. I can make this happen. I can set it up. And even if I don't understand everything that I'm seeing, there's little glimmers of things that I can start to understand. I can feel the understandings beginning. And I can feel the opportunities to pull threads and take in. And free mocap wants to be designed kind of as a tool that teaches you things about how it works. And I think every individual person is going to be pulled in a different direction and sort of drawn to different parts of the thing. And I think that's something we want to encourage. Outside of that, I think from a broader picture of people outside looking in the project, I think I want people to see free mocap and the free mocap project and the free mocap foundation as an example of like, oh, look. Look at what we can make. Look at what you can build if you just step away from the standard path. Look at what we have the capacity to do. We can build tools that perform in the ways that they should, that just work and don't try to take anything from you and just give to you. It is possible to build and give gifts freely given to the world without extracting resources as a result. And I think that I want to be able to show that that's a world you can live in, that that's a thing that you can do, and that we collectively as a group have the options of building things the way that they should be. And that the world that is is not the world that has to be. And that even though the path is forever, the work is there. The handles are there. The shovels are there. We know how to pull. We know what the right direction is. We know how to pull in that direction. We know how to dig the holes that need to be dug. And even if we don't, the distance just looks insurmountable. There is a way to start. And I think that's something I want to show and communicate.,
