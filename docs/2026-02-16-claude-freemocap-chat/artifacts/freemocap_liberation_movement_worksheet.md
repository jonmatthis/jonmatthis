# FreeMoCap as Counter-Hegemonic Project
## A Strategic Worksheet for Liberating Knowledge, Education, and Science

*"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house." — Audre Lorde*

*"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves." — Aaron Swartz*

---

# Framing: What Are We Actually Doing?

FreeMoCap the motion capture software is **Stage 1** — a concrete demonstration that:

- Research-grade scientific tools can be free, open, and accessible to everyone
- You don't need a university affiliation to do real science
- You don't need a $200,000 budget to produce knowledge
- The barriers are artificial, maintained by institutions that benefit from scarcity

The **actual project** is much larger: dismantling the current hegemony of knowledge production — the interlocking system of universities, academic journals, proprietary software, professional credentialism, and institutional gatekeeping that determines who gets to participate in science, education, and the creation of knowledge.

This worksheet helps you develop the intellectual infrastructure for that larger fight.

---

# Part 1: Mapping the Enemy — The Current Hegemony

*Before you can overturn a hegemony, you need to understand it clearly. What are the structures you're fighting? How do they maintain power? What ideology justifies them?*

## 1.1 The Institutional Landscape

**Map the interlocking institutions that control knowledge production:**

| Institution | What it controls | How it maintains control | Ideology that justifies it |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Universities** | Access to education, research resources, credentials | Accreditation, degree requirements, tenure system, facility access | "Expertise requires formal training," "Quality requires institutional oversight" |
| **Academic Journals** | What counts as "real" knowledge, career advancement | Peer review as gatekeeping, impact factors, paywalls | "Peer review ensures quality," "Publishing validates research" |
| **Proprietary Software** | Tools for knowledge production | Licensing, prices, closed formats, vendor lock-in | "Professional tools cost money," "You get what you pay for" |
| **Professional Associations** | Who counts as "qualified" | Certifications, continuing ed requirements, ethical codes as gatekeeping | "Credentials protect the public," "Standards ensure quality" |
| **Funding Agencies** | What research gets done | Grant systems, institutional requirements, overhead rates | "Competitive funding ensures quality," "Accountability requires institutions" |

**Add others you see:**

| Institution | What it controls | How it maintains control | Ideology that justifies it |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## 1.2 The Hegemonic Common Sense

*Hegemony works by making contingent arrangements seem natural and inevitable. What do people currently believe that serves this system?*

**Complete these sentences as a "normal person" embedded in current structures would:**

> "To be a real scientist, you need _______________________________________________"

> "Research isn't valid unless _______________________________________________"

> "Education requires _______________________________________________"

> "If software/journals/education were free, _______________________________________________"

> "People outside institutions can't do real research because _______________________________________________"

> "We need universities because _______________________________________________"

> "Credentials matter because _______________________________________________"

**Where did these beliefs come from?** Who benefits from people believing them?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 1.3 Cracks in the Edifice

*No hegemony is total. Where is the current system failing? Where are people already dissatisfied?*

| System Failure | Who experiences this? | What do they currently blame? |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Reproducibility crisis | Researchers, public | "Bad actors," not systemic incentives |
| Student debt crisis | Students, families | "Expensive schools," not credentialism itself |
| Journal paywalls | Everyone outside elite institutions | "Greedy publishers," not the publication model |
| Adjunctification | Early-career academics | "Budget cuts," not the tenure system |
| Research irrelevance | Practitioners, public | "Ivory tower academics," not funding structures |
| Proprietary lock-in | Researchers, educators | Specific vendors, not proprietary model |

**Add others:**

| System Failure | Who experiences this? | What do they currently blame? |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Key question:** These people are experiencing real problems with the system. How could you help them see the *systemic* cause rather than blaming individuals or specific bad actors?

```

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 1.4 Who Benefits, Who Loses

**Under the current system:**

| Who benefits? | How? |
|---------------|------|
| Tenured faculty at elite institutions | |
| Academic publishers | |
| Proprietary software companies | |
| | |
| | |

| Who loses? | How? |
|------------|------|
| Students (debt, limited access) | |
| Adjuncts and contingent faculty | |
| Researchers at under-resourced institutions | |
| Global South academics | |
| Independent researchers | |
| Practitioners who could use research | |
| The public | |
| | |
| | |

**The people who lose vastly outnumber those who benefit. Why hasn't the system already changed?**

```

# Part 2: The Counter-Hegemonic Vision

*What new "common sense" are you trying to create? What does the liberated landscape look like?*

## 2.1 The World We're Building

**Complete these sentences as someone living in the world FreeMoCap is building:**

> "Anyone can do real science because _______________________________________________"

> "I learned [skill/knowledge] by _______________________________________________"

> "When I need research tools, I _______________________________________________"

> "Knowledge is validated by _______________________________________________"

> "Education happens _______________________________________________"

> "My work is valued because _______________________________________________, not because I have credentials from _______________________________________________"

## 2.2 Core Principles of the New Hegemony

**What are the foundational beliefs of the world you're building?**

*Draft 5-7 core principles:*

```
1. _____________________________________________________________________________

2. _____________________________________________________________________________

3. _____________________________________________________________________________

4. _____________________________________________________________________________

5. _____________________________________________________________________________

6. _____________________________________________________________________________

7. _____________________________________________________________________________
```

**For each principle, articulate:**
- Why it's true (the positive case)
- What current belief it displaces
- What changes if people accept it

## 2.3 Prefigurative Politics

*"Prefigurative politics" means embodying the future you want to create in how you organize now. FreeMoCap should BE the proof that another way is possible.*

**How does FreeMoCap currently embody the principles above?**

| Principle | How FreeMoCap demonstrates this NOW |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

**Where does FreeMoCap fall short of its own principles?** (Be honest)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What would it look like to more fully embody these principles?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

# Part 3: Theory of Change — How Hegemonies Fall

*Smucker is clear: being right isn't enough. You need a plausible theory of how the current system gets replaced by yours.*

## 3.1 Historical Models

**How have previous counter-hegemonic projects succeeded?**

| Movement/Project | What hegemony did they challenge? | How did they win? | What can FreeMoCap learn? |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Free Software Movement | Proprietary software as default | Built viable alternatives, created licensing infrastructure, changed developer culture | |
| Open Access Movement | Journal paywalls | Mandates, repositories, demonstrated demand, Sci-Hub as civil disobedience | |
| Wikipedia | Expert-only encyclopedias | Just built it, proved it worked, became too useful to ignore | |
| Linux | Microsoft/proprietary OS hegemony | Server dominance first, enterprise adoption, Android | |
| | | | |

**What do successful counter-hegemonic projects have in common?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 3.2 Your Theory of Change

**Complete this theory of change for the broader FreeMoCap project:**

> **If** FreeMoCap [does X] _______________________________________________
>
> **Then** [Y constituency] will _______________________________________________
>
> **Which will cause** [Z institutional change] _______________________________________________
>
> **Leading to** [broader shift] _______________________________________________
>
> **Until eventually** [new hegemony] _______________________________________________

**What are the key assumptions in this theory?** What has to be true for it to work?

```
1. _____________________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________________
4. _____________________________________________________________________________
```

**How could you test these assumptions?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 3.3 The Stages

**If FreeMoCap motion capture is Stage 1, what are the subsequent stages?**

| Stage | Focus | Goal | Success looks like | Enables next stage by... |
|-------|-------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **1: FreeMoCap** | Motion capture | Prove FOSS can match/beat proprietary research tools | Adoption in labs, citations, recognized quality | Builds credibility, community, organizational capacity |
| **2:** | | | | |
| **3:** | | | | |
| **4:** | | | | |
| **5:** | | | | |

**What capabilities/resources/credibility do you need to build at each stage?**

```
Stage 1 → 2 requires: ___________________________________________________________
Stage 2 → 3 requires: ___________________________________________________________
Stage 3 → 4 requires: ___________________________________________________________
Stage 4 → 5 requires: ___________________________________________________________
```

## 3.4 Multiple Fronts

*Counter-hegemonic projects usually require pressure on multiple fronts simultaneously.*

**What are the different "fronts" in this fight?**

| Front | What victory looks like | Who's already fighting here? | FreeMoCap's role |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **Tools** (FOSS research software) | FOSS default for research | NumPy, R, Jupyter, etc. | Active combatant |
| **Publishing** (Open Access) | Paywalls gone, new validation models | PLOS, arXiv, Sci-Hub, SPARC | Ally? Participant? |
| **Education** (alternative credentials) | Degrees not required, learning accessible | MOOCs, bootcamps, unschooling | ? |
| **Funding** (alternative models) | Research funded outside grant system | Crowdfunding, DAOs, citizen science | ? |
| **Community** (independent research) | Legitimate research outside academy | Indie researchers, community labs | ? |
| | | | |

**Where should FreeMoCap focus? Where should it build alliances?**

# Part 4: The Public Narrative (Expanded)

*Your narrative must serve the LARGER project, not just the motion capture software.*

## 4.1 Story of Self

*Why are YOU, Jon, fighting to liberate knowledge production? What personal experience made this your fight?*

**The Encounter:** When did you first experience the injustice of the current system? What specific moment showed you something was wrong?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Choice:** What moment of choice committed you to this fight? (Not a gradual drift — a moment when you could have done otherwise but chose this.)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Cost:** What have you given up or risked by making this choice? (Sacrifice demonstrates commitment and values.)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Values:** What deep values drive this work? Not "open source is good" but the VALUES underneath — justice? freedom? democracy? human flourishing?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Draft Story of Self (the version that serves the LARGER project):**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 4.2 Story of Us

*Who is the "we" fighting for liberated knowledge? This must be MUCH bigger than "FreeMoCap users."*

**The broadest possible "we":**

Who has been harmed by or excluded from the current knowledge system?

```
- Students crushed by debt for credentials that gatekeep knowledge
- Researchers at under-resourced institutions
- Global South academics locked out by paywalls and equipment costs
- Independent researchers dismissed as "not real scientists"
- Practitioners who can't access research relevant to their work
- Curious people told "you're not qualified to understand this"
- _____________________________________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________________________________
- _____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The shared experience:** What do all these people have in common?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The shared enemy:** (Not "universities" in general — the SYSTEM, the ideology, the gatekeeping)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The shared vision:** What world are "we" building together?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Draft Story of Us:**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 4.3 Story of Now

*Why is THIS MOMENT critical? What's the urgency?*

**What's happening now that creates opportunity or urgency?**

Consider:
- AI/ML democratizing some capabilities while concentrating others
- Reproducibility crisis delegitimizing current institutions
- Student debt crisis making people question credentialism
- Pandemic demonstrating need for open science
- Growing distrust of institutions generally
- Climate crisis requiring faster/more distributed knowledge production

```
The urgent opportunity: _______________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What window is closing?**

```
If we don't act now: __________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The specific ask (for different audiences):**

| Audience | What do you want them to DO? |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Someone experiencing the system's failures | |
| A potential contributor | |
| A potential ally organization | |
| Someone with resources | |
| Someone with platform/influence | |

**Draft Story of Now:**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 4.4 The Integrated Narrative

**Weave these together. This should take 3-5 minutes to tell. Practice out loud.**

```
[Story of Self — your encounter with injustice, your choice, your values]
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

[Bridge]: "And I discovered I wasn't alone..."

[Story of Us — the shared experience, the shared enemy, the shared vision]
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

[Bridge]: "And right now, we face a critical moment..."

[Story of Now — the urgency, the opportunity, the ask]
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

[The Call]: "That's why I'm asking you to..."

# Part 6: Organizing for the Long Haul

*Counter-hegemonic projects take decades. How do you build an organization that can sustain this?*

## 6.1 The FreeMoCap Foundation as Vehicle

**Is the FreeMoCap Foundation the right organizational vehicle for the larger vision?**

| Consideration | Current State | What's needed for larger vision |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Legal structure | 501(c)(3) | Appropriate? Limiting? |
| Name/brand | "FreeMoCap" = motion capture | Does this scale to larger mission? |
| Mission statement | | Does it articulate the larger vision? |
| Governance | | Appropriate for movement-building? |

**Should there be a broader organizational entity that FreeMoCap is one project of?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 6.2 Developing Leadership

*Ella Baker: "Strong people don't need a strong leader."*

**How do you develop leaders who can carry this forward without you?**

**Current leadership capacity:**

| Person | Current role | Potential | What development do they need? |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**What leadership roles will you need that don't exist yet?**

```
1. _____________________________________________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________________________________________
```

**How do people BECOME leaders in your organization?** (Make this explicit)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 6.3 Organizational Culture

**What culture do you want to create?**

| Value | What it looks like in practice | Current state (1-10) |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Radical accessibility | | |
| Distributed leadership | | |
| Long-term thinking | | |
| Solidarity with allied movements | | |
| Prefigurative practice | | |
