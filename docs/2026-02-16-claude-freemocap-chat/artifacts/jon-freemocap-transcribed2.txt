Okay, I'm going to try to get a broader cut across your questions. So breadth over depth, I guess right now. Yeah, in terms of the question like staying in academia, the actual practical strategy that I took was to after deciding that I couldn't stay sort of deciding that in the context of, I'm not going to try to get tenure at the end of my tenure contract, which was, you know, six year contract. There was a part of me that kind of wanted like when you want to like stomp out the door and be in like a huff or whatever, but that's not actually a strategic move because you're leaving a lot of resources on the table and like you don't have anything to step into. So, you know, I decided that, you know, I signed a contract to be there for several years and I did not, I never, you know, tenure is a two way street, you know, and I had already determined that this institution was not worthy of my, you know, it wasn't morally aligned with my principles. But I was still going to stick around and, you know, use the resources and the time that it afforded me to try to figure out like what, what would be better, like to do the real deep introspective, you know, you know, effort and also just like the work of trying to build an alternative system, which is kind of what free mocap became. And so from a purely practical level, it was, you know, the question was, how can I, what, how can I set up my life and what kind of institutions could I build that would be more, more morally aligned? It was sort of like a prefigurative kind of approach of trying to, you know, just sort of like, like what, what if this institution is not what I think it should be, what is the thing that should be like, what is the like, what would work, what would allow me to continue to be the kind of like scientist and researcher and mentor and teacher and all that I wanted to be without having to be attached to an institution that I couldn't morally stomach. And so free mocap and the free mocap foundation is kind of the answer to that question. To answer your question about the clinical term, it is, free mocap is absolutely part of that. It's sort of like, I feel like I have to have something that I'm working towards and building towards, and I have to feel like I'm somehow pulling in the right direction in order to feel sane. And so free mocap is sort of like the embodiment of that effort and specifically sort of utilizing the specific skill sets and understandings that I have to try to feel like I'm, you know, to get back to that feeling I had of being attached to a good vehicle and pulling the world in a good direction. I think in terms of, you know, who I'm trying to reach, more recently, I think a lot of my focus has really shifted towards like the potential of technology as a liberatory tool. And specifically how I think if enough people in the world sort of gained the kind of technical competency necessary to like really engage in the open source community and like, then we can literally seize back the means of production and, you know, free people of having to live their entire lives attached and managed by technology. You know, free people of having to live their entire lives attached and managed by, you know, corporations. And now at this point in history, governments, because we are entering the, you know, into the AI era. And I think all the kinds of fears and dangers that I was talking about those years ago and those older recordings have just become far sharper and far more poignant. And so a lot of the focus now is starting to shift more in the direction of like, you know, free mocap specifically and then free open source software in general, as a way of like teaching people the skill sets that they would need in order to be able to claw back our culture and our society and our technology from these, you know, corporate entities that, you know, have shown themselves not to be worthy of the power that they have, you know, captured and gathered. And so I think, you know, winning is a hard question. I think in the, right now in the transition, we're moving from, you know, for the personal period of my life, you know, where I was, you know, a professor, still a professor at Northeastern, but this is my last year. So I'm transitioning into the world of trying to figure out how it is possible to support yourself, oneself, a lab scale of, you know, group of people, while building free software that does not, you know, charge subscription fees and, you know, like how do you survive in the world when you're, if you're not going to be attached to like a big research institution or a big corporation. And so that's kind of the question we're trying to answer right now in the very small scale of just like me and two or three other people in my lab. And that would be winning if we can get a stable position there, more broadly and more long term. You know, I would really, the dream is that if I can figure out that one case study of how to support myself as a researcher and educator and mentor and software developer and all the things that I am, by building a tool like FreeMoCap, if I can figure out how to do that, then that could potentially serve as a model that other people start to do. And like FreeMoCap could kind of serve as like a conduit and umbrella and like a support system for people who are trying to achieve their own sense of independence and escape and, you know, whatever it means for them to pull in the right direction. And I think that, you know, that's a long term dream, but the hope would be that like, you know, even though, you know, motion capture is not the, like, in the long list of inequities and wrongs in the universe, like inaccessibility of, you know, marketless motion capture is pretty low on the list, but it is on the list. And if we can sort of solve that tiny inequity, then it might serve as a model of how to solve bigger ones. And if the tool itself can serve as an inroad to like teaching a wider set of people the skill sets necessary to sort of work in the same direction, then it might be a, you know, catalytical project that could, you know, sort of start as a seed and wind up extending and touching things beyond its particular scope and particular domain.",
