# The Soul of FreeMoCap

## A Document of Origin, Mission, and Vision

**Compiled from interviews, lectures, and public statements by Jonathan Samir Matthis, Founder of the FreeMoCap Foundation**

*February 2026*

## Epigraph

> "The world that is is not the world that has to be. And even though the path is forever, the work is there. The handles are there. The shovels are there. We know how to pull. We know what the right direction is. We know how to dig the holes that need to be dug. And even if the distance looks insurmountable, there is a way to start."

# Part I: The Origin Story

## The Before

Jonathan Samir Matthis's path to FreeMoCap was not direct. A philosophy major who applied to philosophy graduate programs and was rejected from all of them—"by grace of God," he now says—he wound up working at an autism research facility, discovered that "data is cool," and eventually found his way to studying the visual control of human locomotion.

By 2019, after years of graduate work and a postdoc, he had achieved what he'd been working toward his entire adult life: a tenure-track faculty position at Northeastern University in Boston. He arrived in summer 2019. The lab was built. The research program was ready to launch.

"I had about a year of like, 'Boy, I sure did make it. And this is probably fine,'" he recalls.

Then came 2020.

## The Breaking

March 2020: COVID hits. Everyone is sent home. The lab sits empty.

But it wasn't the pandemic itself that broke something. It was what the pandemic revealed.

In faculty meetings, Jon watched administrators make calculations that turned his stomach:

> "A dean or some similar type of person said something to the effect that we should encourage our students to get master's degrees because master's students are the best income ratio—they pay full tuition but they don't require any resources. That kind of stuff is super gross."

There was pressure to return to in-person teaching before vaccines existed, "while people are still actively dying all over the place." The reason was obvious: the university needed the money. Safety was secondary.

Then came the moment that crystallized everything.

Jon received a letter saying he could opt out of in-person teaching if he felt uncomfortable. He opted out. Then he received a second letter: the policy had changed. If he opted out, he couldn't come to campus for any reason—including his lab.

> "As a first year research professor, that's basically saying, if you don't come in and teach in person against your will, we're going to tank your career."

His response:

> "Okay, well, fuck you. I'll build my own lab in my house with webcams."

## The $3 Million Webcam

But there was another moment—quieter, more devastating.

Teaching remotely, looking at his webcam, Jon counted the rectangles in the Zoom call. He did the math.

> "I was speaking to a webcam that was worth $3 million a year in student debt."

Bad enough. But then the deeper cut:

> "The reason why they were going into that amount of debt was because of the promise of being able to learn from somebody like me... the fact that I was there doing the thing that I did was part of the recruitment that they used to bring these kids in and to convince them that it's worth it, which it fundamentally isn't and cannot be."

> "More than anything else, that moment was the time when I was realizing finally... I truly cannot stay here. I cannot continue to be in this position."

## The Grief

What followed was not just anger. It was grief.

> "I was 35 years old. I had just gotten the faculty job that I had arguably been working towards my entire life. And then all of a sudden while I'm there, I'm like, oh wait, this place is completely morally bankrupt and diametrically opposed to my worldview. And I can't stay here."

> "Realizing that actually what I was doing had been kind of harnessed and captured by this institution that I frankly despised and was morally repugnant to me—was really, really damaging, really hurtful. Deeply traumatizing, I think."

Jon names this experience with clinical precision: **moral harm**.

> "Moral harm is the specific kind of psychological trauma that occurs when you are forced to participate in an institution or a system that is morally repugnant to you in some way."

## The Discovery

But as faith in one institution collapsed, something else emerged.

During those months of "flailing around in the grief," Jon found himself spending more time with software like Blender—a free, open-source 3D animation tool built over decades by thousands of contributors worldwide and given away freely.

> "In those moments of losing faith in the academic system... seeing something like Blender and starting to understand the business model and the community model... that galvanization happened together. As I was losing faith in the one, I started to gain respect for the other."

The realization crystallized into a sentence he's repeated for years since:

> "The open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be."

Science *claims* to be collaborative, open, building on shared knowledge for the common good. But it's actually siloed, competitive, captured by institutions that prioritize revenue over mission.

The open source community actually *is* what science *pretends* to be.

# Part II: The Response

## Not a Huff

The temptation was to storm out.

> "There was a part of me that kind of wanted—when you want to stomp out the door and be in a huff or whatever—but that's not actually a strategic move because you're leaving a lot of resources on the table and you don't have anything to step into."

Instead, Jon took a strategic approach. He had signed a contract. Tenure is a two-way street—and he had already decided this institution wasn't worthy of his long-term commitment. But he could use the time and resources to build something better.

> "It was sort of like a prefigurative kind of approach of trying to—what if this institution is not what I think it should be, what is the thing that should be? What would allow me to continue to be the kind of scientist and researcher and mentor and teacher and all that I wanted to be without having to be attached to an institution that I couldn't morally stomach."

> "FreeMoCap and the FreeMoCap Foundation is kind of the answer to that question."

## The Pivot: Up vs. Down

The critical insight was about direction.

> "A lot of the effort that I was putting in, almost a very big percentage of the effort I was putting into the world, was made in the service of the people who were above me on the hierarchy and trying to do the things that they wanted me to do so that I could outperform my peers and be allowed to stay in the warm, happy, shining tower."

The shift:

> "One of the big brain shifts that happened was deciding to just stop doing that and to just stop caring or considering what I was being asked to do by people above me in the hierarchy and start asking instead what I could do to support people who were at or below me in that same hierarchy."

This wasn't abandoning ambition. It was redirecting it. Instead of publishing papers to please gatekeepers, he would build tools that serve people who need them.

## What FreeMoCap Actually Is

FreeMoCap is a free, open-source markerless motion capture system. It uses standard webcams and computer vision to track human movement in 3D—the same technology that typically costs tens of thousands of dollars, made accessible to anyone with a laptop and some cheap cameras.

But that's just the surface.

> "We want indie game designers and animators to use the same tool to add motion capture assets to their zero budget art project that I am using for my federally funded scientific research program."

Same tool. Zero budget artist = federally funded researcher. Radical equality of access.

The deeper purpose:

> "I don't want to tell you what you should care about. I'd rather just give you useful tools and let you do what you want to do with it."

And the educational dimension:

> "FreeMoCap wants to be designed kind of as a tool that teaches you things about how it works. And every individual person is going to be pulled in a different direction and drawn to different parts of the thing."

---

# Part III: The Larger Vision

## The Critique

Jon has developed a sharp critique of what he calls the "techno capitalist corpo hegemony":

> "Anytime there's a new technology that comes around, the techno capitalists or just the corporate capitalists basically try to rush to the new domain and start building moats around it so that they can sequester it and then use their access to that thing as a way to exploit the world at large. That is the true core of capitalism—to exploit disparities between yourself and others to extract resources from them."

He sees this pattern repeating with AI:

> "It has come from the techno capitalist corpo hegemony that is the source of so much of the problems and harm in our society."

But he also sees AI differently than previous technologies:

> "They're trying to build moats around the Moat Blaster 9000. Like, it is a tool that will teach you how it works and it will show you everything there is to know about itself. And they're trying to corral it and control it... and it's kind of just not working in the way that they would expect."

> "AI used properly is something that has the ability to be a transformatively liberative tool and one that has the potential to make every single human person that learns how to use it and learns how to wield it a more powerful and capable version of yourself."

## The Stakes

The fears Jon expressed in 2021 have only intensified:

> "All the kinds of fears and dangers that I was talking about those years ago in those older recordings have just become far sharper and far more poignant."

In 2021, he put it starkly:

> "If you're sitting here in 2021 looking at the future and you're not feeling like you're staring down the barrel of a gun, you should probably maybe pay better attention."

## Seizing the Means

The focus has sharpened:

> "A lot of my focus has really shifted towards the potential of technology as a liberatory tool. And specifically how I think if enough people in the world gained the kind of technical competency necessary to really engage in the open source community, then we can literally seize back the means of production."

> "Free people of having to live their entire lives attached and managed by corporations. And now at this point in history, governments, because we are entering into the AI era."

FreeMoCap is explicitly positioned as a gateway:

> "FreeMoCap specifically and then free open source software in general, as a way of teaching people the skill sets that they would need in order to be able to claw back our culture and our society and our technology from these corporate entities that have shown themselves not to be worthy of the power that they have captured and gathered."

# Part IV: The Transition

## This Is the Last Year

As of 2026, Jon is in his final year at Northeastern. The prefigurative period is ending. The alternative must now sustain itself.

> "Right now in the transition, we're moving from—this is my last year [at Northeastern]. So I'm transitioning into the world of trying to figure out how it is possible to support yourself, a lab scale group of people, while building free software that does not charge subscription fees... how do you survive in the world when you're not going to be attached to a big research institution or a big corporation."

## What Winning Looks Like

**Immediate/Survival:**
> "That would be winning if we can get a stable position there."

A small team—"me and two or three other people"—sustaining themselves while building free software. Not getting rich. Just surviving while doing the work.

**Medium-Term/Case Study:**
> "The dream is that if I can figure out that one case study of how to support myself as a researcher and educator and mentor and software developer by building a tool like FreeMoCap, then that could potentially serve as a model that other people start to do."

> "FreeMoCap could serve as a conduit and umbrella and support system for people who are trying to achieve their own sense of independence and escape."

**Long-Term/Catalytic:**
> "Motion capture is not—in the long list of inequities and wrongs in the universe, inaccessibility of markerless motion capture is pretty low on the list, but it is on the list. And if we can sort of solve that tiny inequity, then it might serve as a model of how to solve bigger ones."

> "If the tool itself can serve as an inroad to teaching a wider set of people the skill sets necessary to work in the same direction, then it might be a catalytical project that could start as a seed and wind up extending and touching things beyond its particular scope and domain."

# Part V: The Soul

## What Someone Should Feel

When asked what he wants someone to feel when they successfully capture their first skeleton:

**For users—especially young people or those who feel like technological outsiders:**

> "I want them to kind of think, 'Oh, I can do this. I can make this happen. I can set it up. And even if I don't understand everything that I'm seeing, there's little glimmers of things that I can start to understand. I can feel the understandings beginning. And I can feel the opportunities to pull threads.'"

**For people looking at the project from outside:**

> "I want people to see FreeMoCap and the FreeMoCap Foundation as an example of—look. Look at what we can make. Look at what you can build if you just step away from the standard path. Look at what we have the capacity to do."

> "We can build tools that perform in the ways that they should, that just work and don't try to take anything from you and just give to you. It is possible to build and give gifts freely given to the world without extracting resources as a result."

## The Deepest Message

> "I want to be able to show that that's a world you can live in, that that's a thing that you can do, and that we collectively as a group have the options of building things the way that they should be."

> "The world that is is not the world that has to be."

## Why It Keeps Him Going

~10,000 users worldwide. 115+ countries. Dots on a map.

> "I see you. I see you there in the Faroe Islands. I see you doing your thing... Look at you in Oslo and Stockholm... Look at you in India. Who's this guy? Who are you? That's what I want to know."

> "Thanks for not unchecking the box, guys. I like to see the dots. It really, truly, truly keeps me going to just kind of like, every so often, log and be like, holy shit. You guys are using it."

## The Gatekeeping Instinct He Rejects

One anecdote captures the opposition:

> "There is a reaction that I have had more than once when I talked about the software to people, which is, 'You should be careful not to make it too easy to use, otherwise the students won't understand what's going on in there.' And it's like insane to me to think that."

## Staying Sane

FreeMoCap isn't just a project. It's how Jon manages moral harm:

> "FreeMoCap is absolutely part of that [managing moral harm]. It's sort of like, I have to have something that I'm working towards and building towards, and I have to feel like I'm somehow pulling in the right direction in order to feel sane. And so FreeMoCap is sort of like the embodiment of that effort."

> "Specifically utilizing the specific skill sets and understandings that I have to try to feel like I'm, you know, to get back to that feeling I had of being attached to a good vehicle and pulling the world in a good direction."

# Part VI: The Community

## Named Contributors

From the 2026 State of the Skelly address, Jon names several key contributors:

- **Philip**: "Special shout out... for doing a lot of the plumbing necessary to keep the dang thing up and running and fixing the bugs and making it workable and also just basically dealing with all of my code slop"
- **AJC**: "Inimitable... work in the FreeMoCap community space... made a lot of the work in the Blender add-on"
- **Neon Xdeath**: Wrote the song "Meowmaline" used in early demo video
- **Taylor Davies**: Designed the logo
- **Aaron**: Working with RTM pose and Vit Pose
- **Brother Paul**: Helped with rough cut tutorial

The Discord server has grown to ~2,500 members.

## The De-Centering Goal

> "A big part of the transitional phase... for FreeMoCap over the next five years is one that really continues to build the community around it and kind of de-centers me as a specific person."

# Part VII: Key Quotes Collection

## On Academia

> "None of this is okay. None of the general structure of academia education is morally defensible at almost any level."

> "Most of the research that gets done really shouldn't be done. It's not good research. It's just smart research. It's strategically the right move to get the publication, to get the grants, to get the job, to get the tenure."

> "You're supposed to produce more than two people who are also trying to get tenure at other schools, which is sort of the definition of a Ponzi scheme."

> "The open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be."

## On the Response

> "Okay, well, fuck you. I'll build my own lab in my house with webcams."

> "Stop caring or considering what I was being asked to do by people above me in the hierarchy and start asking instead what I could do to support people who were at or below me in that same hierarchy."

> "It was sort of like a prefigurative kind of approach."

## On Technology and Capitalism

> "The techno capitalist corpo hegemony that is the source of so much of the problems and harm in our society."

# Part IX: Mapping Theory to Jon's Language

The theoretical frameworks from political organizing literature map closely to Jon's natural language:

| Theoretical Concept | Jon's Natural Language |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Gramsci's hegemony | "techno capitalist corpo hegemony" |
| Counter-hegemony / class consciousness | "seize back the means of production" |
| Freire's conscientização (critical consciousness) | "I can feel the understandings beginning" |
| Illich's convivial tools | "tools that just work and don't try to take anything from you" |
| Prefigurative politics | "prefigurative approach" (uses this exact term) |
| Moral injury / institutional betrayal | "moral harm" (uses this clinical term) |
| Banking model of education | critique of "outcompete your peers" model |
| War of position | strategic use of institutional resources while building alternative |

**Recommendation for future documents**: Lead with Jon's language. Use theory to contextualize and deepen, not to frame or impose.
