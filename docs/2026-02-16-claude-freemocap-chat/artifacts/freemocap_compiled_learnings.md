# Compiled Learnings: The Soul of FreeMoCap

This document captures what I've learned from the transcripts and interview that will form the basis of the revised strategic guide. **Note: This is compiled from available sources—claims marked with [?] indicate areas where I'm inferring or where follow-up questions would help.**

---

## Part 1: The Conversion Story

### The Timeline

- **Pre-2020**: Jon describes himself as "totally all in" on academia. Describes having had a "meteoric rise" as a research scientist. Fully believed scientific research was "important and noble and was helping at some fundamental level."

- **January 2020**: Just gotten tenure-track faculty job at Northeastern. Lab built, ready to start. "A very funny time to do planning."

- **March 2020**: Covid hits. Everyone sent home.

- **Summer 2020**: The betrayals begin:
  - Faculty meetings where a dean says they should "encourage students to get master's because master's students are the best income ratio - they pay full tuition but don't require any resources." Jon: "That kind of stuff is super gross."
  - Strong push for in-person classes pre-vaccine while "people are still actively dying all over the place" - clearly prioritizing money over safety.
  - Jon realizes: "You start to see different conversations" once you're on the professor side of the fence.

- **The Breaking Point**: Jon receives letter saying he must teach in-person, with a rider saying he can opt out if uncomfortable. He opts out. Then gets letter from department chair: policy changed. If you opt out of in-person teaching, "you cannot come onto campus for any reason at all, including going into your lab."

  > "As a first year research professor, that's basically saying, if you don't come in and teach in person against your will, we're going to tank your career."

- **The Response**: "Okay, well, fuck you. I'll build my own lab in my house with webcams."

- **The $3 Million Moment**: Teaching remotely, looking at webcam, counting Zoom rectangles. Realizes he's "speaking to a webcam that was worth $3 million a year in student debt." But worse:

  > "The reason why they were going into that amount of debt was because of the promise of being able to learn from somebody like me... the fact that I was there doing the thing that I did was part of the recruitment that they used to bring these kids in and to convince them that it's worth it, which it fundamentally isn't and cannot be."

  > "More than anything else, that moment was the time when I was realizing finally... I truly cannot stay here. I cannot continue to be in this position."

### The Emotional Reality

- **Grief**: "Flailing around in the grief of losing my faith in this institution that I kind of based my life on"

- **Trauma**: "Deeply traumatizing, I think"

- **The Stakes**: "I was 35 years old. I had just gotten the faculty job that I had arguably been working towards my entire life. And then all of a sudden while I'm there, I'm like, oh wait, this place is completely morally bankrupt and diametrically opposed to my worldview. And I can't stay here."

- **Betrayal**: "Realizing that actually what I was doing had been kind of harnessed and captured by this institution that I frankly despised and was morally repugnant to me"

### The Simultaneous Discovery

As faith in academia collapsed, faith in FOSS emerged:

> "In those moments of losing faith in the academic system... seeing something like Blender and starting to understand the business model and the community model... that galvanization happened together. As I was losing faith in the one, I started to gain respect for the other."

> "In those moments of losing faith in one institution, you kind of go back to try to figure out what your own morality was and what your own values are... recognizing [Blender] as another organism, a different institution and a different communal structure that felt like it was more aligned."

## Part 2: The Core Belief

### "The open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be"

This phrase appears in:
- 2022 VFX Futures podcast
- 2022 Biomechanics podcast  
- 2026 State of the Skelly address

It seems to be a central thesis. The claim appears to be that science *says* it is:
- Collaborative
- Building on shared knowledge
- Open
- For the common good

But Jon's experience suggests it's actually:
- Siloed
- Competitive
- "Fighting for survival"
- Captured by institutions that prioritize revenue over mission

**[?] Follow-up needed**: Does Jon see FOSS communities as genuinely achieving these ideals, or as *closer* to them? What are the limitations he sees in FOSS?

---

## Part 3: What FreeMoCap Is For

### The Equality Statement

> "We want indie game designers and animators to use the same tool to add motion capture assets to their zero budget art project that I am using for my federally funded scientific research program."

Same tool. Zero budget = federal funding. This appears to be a core commitment to equality of access.

### The Educational Trojan Horse

> "If accidentally, through the execution of their own desires, they learn a little bit about computer vision and AI and technology and science. That's probably a good thing."

> "The goal for me as a scientist and as an educator is to make a tool that allows you to use these new technologies to do the thing you want to do with as little effort as possible... but also expose to you as much of the underlying technology as I can so that you... now have a little bit of familiarity with this really important and emerging technology just by way of your own desire to do the things you wanted to do."

### Concerns About Surveillance Capitalism

Jon has expressed concern about corporate versions of this technology:

> "Markerless motion capture is going to happen somehow, somewhere. We have the ability to track people accurately through cameras and you better believe we're going to do it as a culture... I am absolutely concerned about what free mocap would look like if it was Facebook mocap... All I can really hope is that making a free open source version of this thing, which is absolutely going to be a technology that is part of our future, hopefully that will provide some sort of protection."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: Is FreeMoCap explicitly conceived as a defensive/preemptive project against surveillance capitalism? Or is this more of an ancillary concern? How central is this to the mission?

### A Sense of Urgency (2021)

> "If you're sitting here in 2021 looking at the future and you're not feel like you're staring down the barrel of a gun, you should probably maybe pay better attention."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: What specifically was Jon referring to here? Has this feeling intensified or shifted since 2021?

### The Target Audience

> "I'm pitching to people at or below me on the social hierarchy, whatever that means. And often what that means is young people."

> "That's all I got sitting here as a white man in power in 2021. That's what I got."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: How does Jon think about his positionality now? What responsibility does he feel comes with his position?

---

## Part 4: The Blender Inspiration

### What Blender Represents

> "I think the open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be. And I think that we should really adopt more of that model."

> "One of the beauties of the open source community is that if you are working on an open source project that's related to another open source project, you just combine forces."

> "A large scale, free, open source software that has its own legs and is growing in really interesting ways. I look at that and I think of that sort of large scale collaborative endeavor with an actual end goal project that is usable and useful for general population. And I see that as like, that's a better model for science. That is how we should be doing science."

### Why Blender Specifically (Technical)

> "If you look at an animation... what you're looking at is artists who have used a GUI to have an incredibly fine grained control over minute aspects of 3D space... Having the tools that are available to animators, available to scientists, will make scientists better scientists and will also connect that artistic side of technology and 3D animation to the sciences and biomechanics."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: What specifically has FreeMoCap borrowed from Blender's model? Where has it diverged? What aspects of Blender's approach don't fit FreeMoCap's situation?

## Part 5: The Community

### Named Contributors (from 2026 State of the Skelly)
- **Philip**: "Special shout out... for doing a lot of the plumbing necessary to keep the dang thing up and running and fixing the bugs and making it workable and also just basically dealing with all of my code slop"
- **AJC**: "Inimitable... work in the FreeMoCap community space... made a lot of the work in the Blender add-on"
- **Neon Xdeath**: Wrote the song "Meowmaline" used in early demo video
- **Taylor Davies**: Designed the logo
- **Aaron**: Working with RTM pose and Vit Pose
- **Brother Paul**: Helped with rough cut tutorial

**[?] Follow-up needed**: Who are these people? How did they find FreeMoCap? Why did they stay? What's the difference between people who download and leave vs. people who become community?

### The Dots on the Map

> "I see you. I see you there in the Faroe Islands. I see you doing your thing... Look at you in Oslo and Stockholm... Look at you in India. Who's this guy? Who are you? That's what I want to know."

> "Thanks for not unchecking the box, guys. I like to see the dots. It really, truly, truly keeps me going to just kind of like, every so often, log and be like, holy shit. You guys are using it."

> "It felt weird to do any data collection, but boy, I don't... it's hard to imagine."

~10K users globally as of 2026.

### The De-Centering Goal

> "A big part of the transitional phase... for FreeMoCap over the next five years is one that really continues to build the community around it and kind of de-centers me as a specific person."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: What would de-centering actually look like? What's currently in the way? Is there anything Jon is holding onto that he shouldn't be?

---

## Part 6: The Path (Philosophy → Neuroscience → FOSS)

### Origin

- Bachelor's in philosophy (philosophy of mind, philosophy of science)
- Applied to philosophy grad programs, rejected from all
- "By grace of God was not accepted"
- Worked at autism research facility: "Oh wow, data is cool"
- Applied to cognitive science programs, planned to study language
- Accidentally ended up with Brett Fajin studying visual control of locomotion
- "I haven't hit the ground yet. So here's hoping."

### The Markerless MoCap Seed

- 2017: Saw OpenPose demo, "That's the future of motion capture"
- Been daydreaming about it since
- Working on proto-markerless mocap in lab pre-Covid
- Covid pivot made it the main project
- "Learned Python during the pandemic. I was a Matlab developer before that and a philosophy major before that."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: How does Jon's philosophy background shape how he thinks about FreeMoCap? Does he still feel like he's "falling" or has he landed somewhere?

---

## Part 7: Tensions and Contradictions

### The Institutional Contradiction

Jon appears to be (or was?) a professor who doesn't trust the ivory tower. Building free tools while potentially employed by institution charging high tuition.

**[?] Follow-up needed**: What's Jon's current relationship to academia? Did he leave Northeastern? How does he navigate the contradiction of being inside an institution he critiques?

### The Telemetry Tension

> "It felt weird to do any data collection, but boy..."

Seems to value privacy and autonomy, but the ping data showing global usage appears emotionally sustaining.

**[?] Follow-up needed**: How does Jon think about this tension? What's the ethical line for data collection in his view?

### The Proprietary Dependency

Currently depends on MediaPipe (Google) for core functionality. Jon is aware of the irony:

> "I can't say trust and Google in the same word. That's not a good idea."

**[?] Follow-up needed**: How does Jon think about depending on Google tools while building a project partly motivated by concerns about corporate tech?

### The Scale vs. Sustainability Tension

~10K users, small team, "low available effort." 

**[?] Follow-up needed**: What's the actual resource situation? How many hours, how much help, how much money? What would sustainable look like?

## Part 9: What the Current Document May Be Missing

Based on this material, the current "Theory to Victory" guide might benefit from:

1. **The visceral origin story** - the blackmail, the $3M webcam moment, the grief
2. **The personal stakes** - 35 years old, life's work, institutional betrayal
3. **The emotional register** - trauma, grief, rage, hope
4. **The specific enemy** - not abstract "hegemony" but concrete institutional experiences
5. **The simultaneity** - losing faith in one institution while discovering another
6. **The position** - awareness of being a "white man in power" trying to give tools to those below

**[?] Needs verification**: Does the theoretical framing (Gramsci, Illich, Freire, McAlevey) resonate with how Jon actually thinks? Does he use that language? Where does it fit and where does it miss?
