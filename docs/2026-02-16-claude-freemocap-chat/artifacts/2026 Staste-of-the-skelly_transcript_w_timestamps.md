### Chunk 1 [00:00:00 - 00:09:59]

**[00:00:00]** All right, I'm gonna go ahead and start. It's funny, I referenced the purple monkey recording here, which is the most viewed video on the Primo Cap sort of pantheon. And it starts with a similar kind of like lament about the. The parasocial weirdness of like trying to like pull up the energy of talking to a group when you're actually sitting in an empty room talking to a webcam. So it feels appropriate that we shall be sort of doing similar things now.

**[00:00:31]** All right, and three, two, one, go. What's up? Okay. Hello everybody and welcome to the 2026 State of the Skelly address. My name is Jonathan Samir Mathis.

**[00:00:40]** I am the creator, president and CEO of the Frimo Cap foundation, which is a 501c3 IRS certified public charity dedicated to the development and dissemination of scientific and educational, free and open source software, among other things. It is 2026, which by some math that we're going to sort of show in a second here means that freemo cap is approximately 5 years old. Depending on how you start counting, could be six, I guess, if you really wanted to be it that way. But I think FreemoCap as like a, like a thing specifically is about five years old, which is quite a long time. The nature of these types of project is that they get bigger as they grow, the surface area increases, the complexity increases, and the need to sort of manage the project in different ways changes as well.

**[00:01:32]** So this presentation is both to give a little bit of context for people who kind of are like floating around, sort of wondering about how things are going with the project. People might sort of wander in and out from the street and people who have been around for a while who kind of want to have a sense of, of where we currently are and where we are going in the future, mostly focusing on the next year, but we can go, keep going from there. So we are entering or we're somewhere around five years old. And it's been a long and fun journey since then. I'm going to go through in the sort of traditional three way, three part.

**[00:02:09]** I'm going to talk about a quick abbreviated history of freemocapt. Not because it's super important, but because it's sort of like, I think it's just good to tell the story every now and again. So that way the general history in sort of context is sort of known, a big part of the transitional phase. And I'm sort of hoping for free mocap over the next five years is one that really, you know, continues to build the community around it and kind of like de centers me as a specific person. But for now at least, freemocap is really very, very tied up in the situation in this rough vicinity of the world.

**[00:02:44]** So having a little sense of the background in the current context will be helpful, I think, for people who are following along. Then we'll talk about the current state numbers and financials and sort of clients, people who work, we're working with, and then talk, hopefully probably more of the time. A lot of the time will be spent talking about the future plans specifically around the transition to v2, the version 2 of the software which we are currently transitioning to. Talk about some work I've been doing building something like curriculum around freemo Cap and Shop and some other stuff and yeah, just general projects that we have floating right now. So part one, we're just going to do a quick abbreviated timeline of free mocap.

**[00:03:25]** I would say that it roughly started around 2017 when open pose happened for the first time. Really should have the GIF show up here of them using it. But after, I would say that was the first time I saw a viable markerless motion capture system that was capable of doing the 2D skeleton tracking. That is the sort of the core technology that makes freemocap work as a markerless motion capture system. So from there, after that I was, you know, I was hired at Northeastern in 2019 and had one year of sort of standard human professorship for 2020.

**[00:03:58]** Hit Covid hit and March of 2020, we all went into quarantine. And then through various ways and means, around August of 2020, I lost all faith in the scientific, educational and academic process. And. And then sort of roughly around that time of transitioning from somewhere around 2020 to somewhere around 2021, I reacquainted myself and realigned myself from standard academic to more free open source zealot, largely inspired by Blender and sort of understanding that this statement that the open source community is what the scientific community pretends to be and they have a cat walking around. And also in the standard cat way of things, I have no idea how to do that with my computer, but somehow she always finds it with her feet.

**[00:04:49]** Okay, yeah. So going through a quick sort of history of the actual technicals of the project, this is. I went back and found the first public post which was 2021, January 2021, sort of. This was open pose, four cameras. And I think, God, who even knows?

**[00:05:07]** I doubt this code is. I doubt I could even find anymore. I'm not sure if it was on GitHub. Oh, did we just lose. Sorry, more cat crawling around.

**[00:05:17]** Problems. Pulled out the camera. Okay, we're back. So 2021, this was the first public post on Twitter and then this one, 2021. So what is that about six months later?

**[00:05:29]** This was now what I like to call the Meowmaline video because the song that is playing in the background here, there's a song playing in the background which is Meowmaline, which is written by the inimitable Neon Xdeath in the server. So I made this video using. I guess you would call that the pre alpha version of. It doesn't even have a version on here. They have a date.

**[00:05:52]** I didn't put a date on it. Rookies. Rookie mistakes. And yeah, posted it to Twitter, got a lot of attention and I think that was probably the. The first big boost of sort of people giving a.

**[00:06:04]** About these silly skeletons. I guess they already had the logo at that point. That was designed by the also inimitable Taylor Davies, who. I don't know why people are always trying to imitate folks. Can you make that go away?

**[00:06:19]** What came next? Oh, wait. Oh, that's not. That's not the Purple Monkey video at all. That's annoying.

**[00:06:25]** One second, let me find. That's the month. What? Anyway, so this video came out also around three years ago using. Yeah, this was part of a application for Epic Megagrant which we did wind up getting eventually.

**[00:06:38]** And it has a sort of brief manifesto of the reasons for and you know, sort of like motivation behind Freemo Cap. And it's sort of still front and center on the website and still gets a lot of views. Still gets more views than anything else combined. Well, that's not really true. Well no, it is true actually.

**[00:06:57]** And I should reprocess it with the new version. I still have the data, it would work. I would be able to reprocess it with a new version with a new Skelly. But I do kind of like the Purple Monkey just because this was first getting started around the blender. So that's pretty.

**[00:07:12]** That's the one. I also did post this rough cut tutorial with the invaluable help of brother Paul. There was also a cat who was being rambunctious in the video in a similar sort of sense of this was rough cut because I was going to edit it down and then that was like whatever three years ago. It's fine. Yeah.

**[00:07:32]** And then September 2023 was the release of version one. At that point I think there was no fanfare. It was more of a quiet, quiet affair of just pushing it. I think it was like it had like, we had a bunch of versions that had RC on the end. And then at one point I was just like, okay, I think 1.1 was the first one without the RC.

**[00:07:51]** So it was a little bit, what's the word? Anticlimactic. Because it was just sort of. Yeah, we skipped 1.0 and actually went straight to 1.1. But that's this one and that is the current architecture that we are still using.

**[00:08:03]** It has improved a lot in many, many ways, I think special shout out to Philip specifically for doing a lot of the plumbing necessary to keep the dang thing up and running and fixing the bugs and making it workable and also just basically dealing with all of my code slop in there. There was a lot being learned here. And ultimately the way that these kind of projects work, it is typically the decisions you make first that burn you in the end. And that's kind of the situation with 1.0 here, even as we are now onto what's the next slide look like? 1.7 now with many, many, many improvements in the background now mostly at the data level, some at the UX UI level, some at the base functionality level.

**[00:08:46]** I think it's 1.7 that adds to ground plane calibration, which is a big technical leap. And yeah, just a thousand tiny tweaks to make things good. I'm not going to talk too much about the details here about a lot of the parts because that those things kind of deserve their own video. But anytime I'm showing Blender in the add on, I have to give one of you know, probably several dozen appropriate shout outs to old AJC for his hit again, inimitable third time inevitable work in the Freemo cap sort of community space. And he made also a lot of the work in the Blender add on.

**[00:09:22]** Yeah, so that was so November 23rd, that was about two years ago and then a long slow inching up from there. So around that, around that time I was trying to look if, in my, in the records of the social medias, if there's any specific moment that I could cite as the moment where I decided that we needed to slow the growth curve a bit and I couldn't quite find anything. So it's somewhere in that range of like 23 to 25 that I was. The community was growing, but it was growing kind of fast. And because there was, because it's a complicated software with many just.

---

### Chunk 2 [00:09:45 - 00:19:45]

**[00:09:45]** Curve a bit and I couldn't quite find anything. So it's somewhere in that range of like 23 to 25 that I was. The community was growing, but it was growing kind of fast. And because there was. Because it's a complicated software with many just.

**[00:10:00]** It's just, it's. Even if it was a perfect software, it would be hard to use and it's not a perfect software. So like I was just concerned about the rate at which people were coming in. Yeah. So sometime around the 23, 24 range the project started to grow and it was.

**[00:10:19]** Yeah. And it started to get a little. I was concerned because I was feeling. I think that might have been around the time that I read this book for the first time or I haven't read it multiple times, but it. I read it once and it was very formative.

**[00:10:34]** Nadia Egbal Working in Public Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software so the book is kind of a like an anthropological survey of open source software developers. And one of the main conclusions is that the. The primary resource to be maintained and protected in an open source environment is maintainer energy because maintainer burnout, which maintainer is the person who maintains the code for those that don't know. And maintainer burnout is the number one cause of, of death for open source software projects. And I was concerned that as people started, as the project started to grow and the surface area started to grow, we didn't really have the infrastructure to receive the people that were coming in because of kind of the inherent contradictions associated with the core mission of freemocap which is to make a software which is simultaneously a high level, high performance research software, but also something that is usable by 13 year olds and people without technical background that's inherently in conflict with itself.

**[00:11:38]** And so that started to. Started to feel that and so basically just stop posting, stop streaming. Just the stopping of streaming was less of the control thing. It's just I. Streaming is just, you know, somewhat exhausting for me, but I suspect it was something around here when you can kind of. And it worked.

**[00:11:57]** It worked actually quite well. So we stopped doing posting. So the. At that point the scale was such that there was enough organic growth that people were kind of making their way in. I was sort of, you know, getting into a conference every now and again and then it's really focused the energy on.

**[00:12:11]** And then we also have really good SEO because it's people. A lot of people search for free motion capture it turns out. And so when they do, they find us and then you know, a lot of the effort of developing the project is making it sort of accessible to more people and then more people show up. So we focus a lot of energy on the discord community community. And having, you know, the, the, the weekly community calls have been really nice sort of anchor points and once again shouting out the specifically ajc, but also just all the people in the server who kind of just like picked up, picked up the shovel and started to help.

**[00:12:48]** Mostly in terms of just helping the people who showed up, you know, get the thing installed, you know, oh, hey, my can't tap my cameras. Oh my calibration didn't work. You know, all the things that realistically could have been solved by like ux, better ui, better documentation, you know, all that kind of stuff and all the things that we are developing and have continued to develop, but because they didn't exist at that time, a lot of that sort of work was sort of pulled by people in the community itself again, specifically Andres. But a lot of people are sort of in there talking and. Yeah, and it's really, it's been really sort of gratifying to watch that happen and sort of like, you know, appreciate the kind of the space that that buys, you know, like just sort of holding, holding the thing up a little bit just every time you respond to a message.

**[00:13:36]** And that really gave, you know, me and the core devs like the time that was needed to actually write the code. And so now here we are in. And now I think we're, we're kind of ready, we're kind of ready for, you know, the things to become. I think that, you know, like version two is a full refactor of version one. I think it will be generally more amenable to accepting outside help.

**[00:13:56]** And I think we're sort of ready to start, start up again, which is good because I guess the dates cut off here. But posted this with Paul the other day and it, you know, went out to the various socials who apparently are still aware that I exist to some extent because that, when, that, that's when this happened. So these are the stars, these are the basically like, you know, points on GitHub people that like the repository. This was the meowling post. This was sort of the long, slow, healthy, steady growth there.

**[00:14:26]** And then I, you know, we make one more post and then this happens and it's like, see, this is why, this is why you don't want to wake up. And then there's another zero on your user base. That's not, that's not comfortable. Yeah, this is and I think a nice representation of like about the current state of the data. This is nice, very clean data.

**[00:14:44]** Someone on a, you know, perfect treadmill, perfect lighting and yeah, it looks, looking pretty dang good. So that's a bit of the history, that's kind of how we got here. Now let's look at the current state of the thing, state of the project. Again. This, this particular presentation will not be focused too much on the technical side of freemo Cap.

**[00:15:02]** This is that like org level kind of thing. So by the numbers GitHub stars we have 4533 that you know, sort of slow growth over time there. The discord server has 3,000 plus people in it. Global users have over 10,000 and 140 people reached which we will sort of take this moment to take a brief aside field trip into freemocap.orgdata.HTML sort of up here on the panel. This panel is going to change how it looks in a second but you'll, you'll figure it out.

**[00:15:32]** And so this is, this is the growth curve over the, these are all the people. So these are the pings from the front of the GUI versus you know, uncheck if you don't want to send anonymous pings or whatever. And so these are all the pings that have come in. Actually these are not the pings, these are the unique IPs, these are the, the people who, which is our proxy for like individual people. And this is.

**[00:15:56]** I stole this plot from climate change representation. But it's, I think it shows here. And yeah, so if we look. So this is the fun animation and this is the more static chart. We got users everywhere, all over the place.

**[00:16:11]** We have received 42,000 total pings from that thing which if you kind of assume that like most people, if you see the box that says share anonymous data, most people say no so. Or I think I'm guessing it's probably about half that might be optimistic, pessimistic, hard say. And yes, the. So yeah, so these are underestimates. And then the users sort of estimated users are sort of the unique IPs which is of course, you know, not accurate for a number of reasons.

**[00:16:41]** 140 countries represented by, from those pings, including you know, the. So I made this blob after I scheduled this talk and when I saw this I'm like, wow, maybe I shouldn't have scheduled it in the evening on the east coast because this is the middle of the night for where apparently our biggest core of people is which is Central Europe specifically in the kind of Germany, France, England era area which is where a lot of like research labs are. We got a lot of people over. A lot of people in India, a lot of people in China. This is their total uses over time.

**[00:17:14]** These are new users per day and this is pings per day. I could be flipped. So rate of growth is growing. And then this is some analysis of like do people come back? Because a lot, you know, almost half of these people are single shot like bouncers.

**[00:17:29]** Like they, they see it, they turn it on, they can't figure it out and they leave. So this number I, I think is kind of like a key with like a performance number I really want to look at is like, you know, how many pings do we get? But how many times do people come back? Like we want people to be sticking around and learning how stuff works. Which is, you know, a design question that we'll get to.

**[00:17:49]** Yeah, yeah. So US is the. Is the biggest. China's number two. Germany, India, France, Australia, United Kingdom.

**[00:17:58]** There are approximately 49,000 free mocap users for 100,000 square kilometers of land in Monaco. So in case you were wondering about that. Anyways, I had some fun making these data blops. But yeah, so, so it. So the growth rate I would say is nice and healthy and I think pretty neat that it is continuing to grow organically just through, you know, word of mouth and SEO.

**[00:18:22]** So you can kind of see, I think like there are probably some moments around here where I was like oh, maybe we should slow down and then. But generally speaking the pattern here shows that like we are growing and the rate of growth is increasing. So feels pretty healthy and it does look like nuclear war. But you'll be okay. Skelly will save you.

**[00:18:42]** Yeah. To do where I was I. Nope, not that I lost the presentation again. Okay. So yeah, so that's so doing pretty okay there. So now let's keep.

**[00:18:52]** So now the financials. I'm not going to go into too much detail here. There this I should maybe, I don't know, I didn't really plan out too much of this. So in terms of financials and you know, as a 501c3 public charity, our numbers are. They are publicly available through IRS 990s.

**[00:19:11]** Our 990s have not I think made it to like ProPublica at all yet. But I assume they'll be there by next year. Long story short, we're doing okay. The up until now freemocap has largely and I would say has been, you know, by the numbers, primarily supported by the fact that I am currently employed at a university that shall remain nameless. And because freemocap is a part of my research program, this is kind of, you know, it's overlapping with my responsibilities there enough that I've been able to continue to sort of work on it here.

**[00:19:43]** However, a big part of.

---

### Chunk 3 [00:19:30 - 00:29:30]

**[00:19:30]** Employed at a university that shall remain nameless. And because freemocap is a part of my research program, this is kind of, you know, it's overlapping with my responsibilities there enough that I've been able to continue to sort of work on it here. However, a big part of the, you know, losing faith in academia thing that I mentioned was part and parcel with like basically making the decisions in service of the things that I think I thought should exist, which is free mocap. While understanding that that was not going to my, my life and academia and are not compatible for moral reasons, I. There's a lot more that I can say about that and I will tell that story in its entirety, but not while I am still employed by said employer.

**[00:20:16]** And so that moment. And so basically we are now approaching a scary cliff on the road that I chose for myself five or six years ago, which is the end of my official contract. So now the question has. So the question of six years ago was can I set something up that will allow me to continue to live roughly the kind of life I like to live doing research and building tools and teaching and doing mentorship and all that kind of stuff without having to be attached to a degree granting institution that charges $93,000 a year for, for tuition, room and board for these exactly the undergraduate students that are my responsibility. And so I've had five plus years to plan for it and the time is now coming and again, I think we're doing okay.

**[00:21:06]** So we'll be able to survive past the, you know, the last paycheck of June 30th. We'll still be able to keep paying Philip, we'll still be able to start paying Aaron and the various ET Als around and I'll be able to continue paying my myself. The question mark I think now is about, you know, we will survive, will we thrive? This is the question. These are the questions of the next 4, 6, 3, 445 months.

**[00:21:33]** And a lot of it I think is dependent on how some things pitch pan out and also, you know, but ultimately I think we're doing okay. I will promise you a more specific update next year here, but for now I'm going to leave it at that. A big part of. So a big part of the question with something like remote cap is, you know, how do you make money selling a free software? And the answer is it's hard and complicated and probably something we can talk about in various ways.

**[00:22:00]** But long story short, there's been the financial strategy that I've been approaching is based off of Stocking the records of every open source project that I can think of. And, and it's basically to do something of a patchwork approach. So you have a number of different routes that you take to try to bring in money and they all have different validity at different timescales and they bring in different amounts to different, you know, whatever currently. So eventually the plan will be to be, you know, we're building the infrastructure to start applying for grants which you know, it's a simple, it's we, we run relatively light so a single sort of like solid grant would sort of would serve us for pretty well. And I have some targets for that in mind probably sometime in June and then the NSF Pose Award is something that we're going to be applying for in September.

**[00:22:51]** But the main sort of short term target that we're looking at bringing a little bit of money is looking at clients. And so right now we have two research partners that are paying us to do dedicated work. Ben Scholl. The name Ben Scholl shall ring loudly in the histories of Freemo Cap for being kind of the first person to, you know, not the first person to pay us anything but the first person to really like, you know, develop like a long term research connection centered around doing motion capture and eye tracking in ferrets. And so this is a video that we put together before sfn.

**[00:23:26]** This is a ferret wearing a binocular eye tracker. We actually have better stuff kind of floating around. Recently made some advances. The reason why I haven't been able to work on Freemo CAP since SFN Society for Neuroscience conference in November or whatever is because I've been doing ferret stuff. But it's really fun and it's kind of like this is the kind of work that's more akin to like the you know, standards of like high science and you know, academia and like you know, big publications and stuff like that.

**[00:23:53]** Also not the most generally applicable to the world. I guess not everybody has an animal research lab. But it's, it's been really fun sort of coming back into that space with the skill sets that you know, me and Aaron and Philip et al have accrued building Freemodel Cap and being able to kind of go back into these scientific research questions and just like just do stuff that you just can't do as a science like a standard academic for a lot of different reasons. And I think it's going to go. There's, there's a lot, my scientific career I do not believe is over despite the fact that My official academic employment is coming to an end.

**[00:24:32]** Free MOCAP is sort of at its core a research institute. So I'm just now a self employed rogue scientist doing eyeball work on tiny animals. So the, the latest addition to the short list of wonderful, wonderful people is Diego Fernandez who works at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical College, who we met through his student Burgundy Walters at Society for Neuroscience in San Diego. And they have commissioned us to build a mouse eye tracker. So smaller than a ferret, but we can, I think it's handleable for, you know, again into the technicals.

**[00:25:12]** But there's, there's a, I will post this, the a link to this sort of information in the description to the video. So you can go to the video. In this video there's a longer description of the methods that are being used. But we have, yes, we have also been commissioned to build a mouse eye tracker for Diego Fernandez specifically to look at pupillometry over sort of extended periods of time. So if you are a person who studies mice and are interested in doing mouse eye tracking, this is a really good time to reach out to us to, to get sort of, you know, early bird special.

**[00:25:45]** I guess as we are building the thing to begin with, this is a good time to sort of let it be known what your specs are and you can be more, you can support it early on or you can buy it later and it's I guess advantages for both. But you know, reach out to us if you have thoughts more generally, I guess slides are just a little bit out of order. We are now offering paid service contracts. So unofficial logo, unofficial motto is knowledge is free. Labor is unbelievably expensive.

**[00:26:14]** So if you have funding and are interested in building particular research apparatuses, tracking the eyes of some strange animal, combined motion capture, eye tracking in any context, or just generally setting up freemo CAP as a research tool, let us know. It is not. Yeah, it's. Yeah, reach out to us through this services page on our website and yeah, we can, we can talk. It's, it's not cheap work.

**[00:26:38]** These are not like. And no offense, but I do not run. I do not want to write a grant with you. If I, if you want to write me into a grant, I'm happy to do that. But it's, you know, at this point in the project I'm not really in a position to like do free work for people.

**[00:26:53]** So if you currently have funding and are interested in working and building tools, let us know and always happy to talk but you know, gotta be really protective of the actual labor these days. We're also like, I'm not really pushing this quite yet. There's gonna be, I think, more of this towards the like once the V2 kind of comes online, but kind of like pushing for like, you know, bronze, silver, gold sponsorship types of thing using a very similar model to Blender, where you kind of have a website that you can sort of put people's names on, you know, company logos and stuff like that. So if you are a business or working with a business who might want to, who sort of, whose interests are aligned with freemo Caps, I guess and sort of like if, if, if it is in your interest for freemocap to be sort of successful and have specific sort of shapes reach out to us and we can, yeah, corporate sponsorship, the general sort of structure there is like we put your logo in some place of honor and then you get to have kind of conversations with us around, you know, like it's like shift. Like I'm not going to shift the project, but I might shuffle the priority list based off of, you know, what the, what the constraints are.

**[00:28:01]** And we are, you know, a certified public charity, so we are any. So donations are tax exempt. See. Is there anything else to say here? I guess we're.

**[00:28:11]** Yeah. So let's move it on. So that's about the current state of things. Let's. Let's talk about the feature again.

**[00:28:16]** Kind of a strange choice of link. Oh, that's why I lost it. But here. GitHub freemo cat projects 34. This is the Freemo Cap planning operations.

**[00:28:26]** You can get to it through the. Oh, I see how that works. The Primo Cap foundation repository. But this is a place that you, you know, come check this to see what kind of the, the task list is. We, we keep it relatively up to date.

**[00:28:39]** It may not capture all the details, but we're sort of getting into that. Okay, so the biggest news of the sort of, the biggest future plans, sort of the current work plan is the transition from the version one of the software which we've been using since 2023 into version 2.0. 2.0 is a complete sort of more or less from scratch refactor of version one. I think there might be some parts that survive, even though I, Even though I pains me to say so, but I think there might be. I think it might be a 100% reset from scratch refactor.

**[00:29:14]** But all the main parts are different and sort of generally built in an architecture which is sort of more modern, more robust, more professional and critically more amenable to outside help. It turns out that if you have sloppy code.

### Chunk 4 [00:29:15 - 00:39:15]

**[00:29:15]** All the main parts are different and sort of generally built in an architecture which is sort of more modern, more robust, more professional and critically more amenable to outside help. It turns out that if you have sloppy code, it is harder for people to help you out with it. But as the sort of general sophistication of like my skill set and the general sophistication of the software improves, it should become easier to bring more people in. So again, looking at this book. So Nadia Egg Ball differentiates between four types of projects.

**[00:29:50]** You got your toys with small, small users and small user and small developer base stadium stadiums, which is a lot of users and a small number of developers. Oh, I got these backwards clubs which are more developers than users, which is like Astropie and then Federations, which is sort of like a good mix of developers and users. And right now freemokap is very much a stadium. Small number of users, a very small number of developers and a very large number of users. Pretty large number of users that is.

**[00:30:27]** It's sort of. It's been somewhat necessary of up until now just because the tool itself is so complex. And I've been really protective of like going in there and like filling around like, like very, very protective of who actually gets to like contribute code to the software, which is sort of good in some ways because it keeps things working and it helps us to avoid tech debt which can you know, really. Tech debt and bloat and like, you know, meandering a focus which can I think really kill a project like this. But ultimately we really want to transition to a world where we can have yeah, a more, more, more people helping out, more people lending hands and yeah, female cap has that again.

**[00:31:06]** I'm not going to go too much into the technicals here I think, but I think there's. I gave a stream a couple, I guess months ago now about you know, a deep dive into Skelly Cam and I think a new one of those is about red, like percolating and ready for a deep dive into like the V2 architecture. So we'll talk about that when we get to it. But currently version two lives on the development branch of Freemo Cap core, Freemo Cap repository and all the sub skellies. So if you go to the development of FreeMo Cap, you can install that and see what version two is sort of going to look like.

**[00:31:39]** Currently it looks like this, which the UI is, is again kind of busted, but it is functional and it's kind of a react electron front end with a Python fast API server, back end and then yeah, we'll talk more about that at some future time. I'm going to come back to this UI in a second. So the release plan is going to go through a standard development cycle. So currently we are in a state I call Pre Alpha. Pre Alpha is where it's like it's known to be broken.

**[00:32:06]** Like it's not like you can use the free. The V2 you can use. It does have real time processing which we have shown works at sfn. It does not have post type post offline. What am I saying?

**[00:32:21]** Yeah, it's so it's work. We're currently in state where like the best workflow we actually have right now is to use the version 2 of Skellycam to record the videos and then process them with the version one. So getting from the state of like fixing all the parts that we know are broken is what we was how we transitioned from Pre Alpha to Alpha. So Pre Alpha is known busted. Alpha is now possibly working.

**[00:32:46]** I am not aware of any specific things that are known to be broken within the software. We're also going to be transitioning from this. So this UI is kind of like it's built on good bones, so to speak, but it is not. It's. It's ugly, you can tell.

**[00:33:02]** And so we're going to be another remote or cell. Another person who deserves some laudations is Puya who has been working on this sort of new UI here. It's got a nice splash screen. These little guys got this cool skelly and some links, you know, and generally just a much better, much nicer looking more modern I guess you'd say soft, just ui. The only issue is that it's not, it's not correct.

**[00:33:32]** So Puya, Pui was looking at the V1 GUI when he was designing this. So a lot of the workflows are just kind of like not quite right for that. Like the way things are going to be in V2 because it's like things have changed a bit. And so we, we, he and I have talked, we both kind of got busy but basically the plan was to kind of like use this UI to just get it over the hump. So of like, okay, let's just like make sure all the pieces work in the connection of the front end GUI to the back end processor and then sort of in parallel to that we can start taking inspiration from like the workflows that have sort of started to emerge in the version 2 to adapt as UI so that we can then sort of transition over.

**[00:34:14]** There's also a lot of stuff in like the like redux and state management. Those are just. It's complicated. So, so we will. So, so in the transition from pre alpha to Alpha, whether it's before or during, is when I envision that sort of transition to, to occur.

**[00:34:33]** Once it's in alpha, the idea is that I would be able to like that's, that's when we say you should use this. It's work, it works. It, it will be better than version one for a lot of reasons, mostly skellycam. A lot of the actual data processing may not change that much at first but, but the Skellycam integration is a big technical improvement and also it will handle like real time processing so you'll be able to have real time reconstruction but you will also still be able to record the videos at full resolution and frame rate so you can post process as well. So yeah, I think if I had planned my life a little better, I'd be giving a little demo of it right now.

**[00:35:09]** But it's kind of just. I made the data dashboard instead of doing that. So yeah, alpha is possibly working. Let me kick the tires a couple, a little bit and sort of start off inviting people in and then let the world discover that it's actually a busted and broken piece of thing. And then as it gets sort of kicked around in alpha mode for a while, eventually it starts to get to a point where we would move it up to what we would call a beta.

**[00:35:35]** I think historically we've skipped beta. In some cases we may wind up skipping beta now, but beta is kind of like I am not aware of anything currently broken. It's right, that was alpha. Beta is like, it might actually be like ready to for full. Historically in most contexts alpha is closed and then beta is open.

**[00:35:55]** But since we are open source kind of they kind of bleed together. But then once we sort of get from there, we'll go to the full release B2 probably we'll do some kind of like you know, end of life, like you know, sort of lts long term support, like support for version one, but probably not. It might just kind of reach a point where it's like it kind of. Here's V1. It is what it is.

**[00:36:16]** It's probably not getting better. If you need, you can use it until you're ready to transition onto version 2. Anyway that's roughly the plan and yeah, so now let's. There's a couple more little pieces to talk about timeline wise at some Point in past I said that we would have something out by quarter by the end of the first quarter, which would be the end of March. Optimistically I think we should hopefully be living in V2 Alpha mode by the end of March.

**[00:36:45]** But you know, historically, you know, every estimate should be multiplied by some factor. So we'll see. And then I, I, I don't think it's too optimistic to say that by June or so we'll be in full V2 land. Oh, I also didn't have it on the, on the, the, the slide here, but a huge part of the V2 planning and V2 architecture is single click installer would like the ability to install it, run it and use it without ever touching the command line is something that we don't currently have. We sort of have it with the PI app installers but those are not the most stable for a variety of reasons.

**[00:37:20]** So version two will have like a proper regular old standalone installer. I figured out how to do code signing so you're your virus checker shouldn't eat it up and that's, that should be a world where we're living, you know, freemocap.org download and it's just like every other software you've ever used in your life. And that is a time I think once that milestone gets hit of you can use it without ever touching a terminal. I think that's when that plus real time plus like the improvements to the, just the animation outputs and then the general like scientific validity of it increasing. I think that once we have the standalone installer kind of like really solidly working, that's when the vibes of the project might change a lot.

**[00:38:03]** I think that no matter how easy you make it to install something from terminal, the terminal itself is going to knock out at least 90% of your possible user base. So you know, I think given the bones that we already have with this sort of terminal based kind of janky app, my belief is that once we sort of transition to a more modern looking, you know, sophisticated architecture, that's when we might see another zero show up. Every so often, you know, we, I post one 20 second clip of someone on a treadmill, we, we see a noticeable jump in the, in the, what's the word? The star count. So who knows?

**[00:38:43]** Who knows? Yeah, something. That's something. Not a lot of detail here the version 2, but I do want to make the official public announcement. The version 2 data model will be wildly different from the version.

**[00:38:53]** So up until now we've done a fair amount of work to keep things kind of like backwards compatible in, across the different versions and try to do open close type of stuff. So we added a lot of new stuff, but we tried to keep things kind of where they were so that if you're a grad student, anyone who has some animator who has a bunch of.

---

### Chunk 5 [00:39:00 - 00:48:59]

**[00:39:00]** And you know, across the different versions and you know, try to do, you know, open close type of stuff. So like we added a lot of new stuff but we tried to keep things kind of where they were so that if you have, if you're a grad student, anyone who has some animator who has like, you know, a bunch of pipelines built on a particular data model, we don't, we try not to break that. Version two is going to break all of that. We probably build some kind of like adapter thing because the core reality of like, if you like you'll still be able to process and reprocess or old, old stuff because as long as you have synchronized videos and calibration data, we can, we can work with it, we can, we can build from it. But we're, we're definitely stepping back and we're going to like rebuild the data model from the ground up in a sort of.

**[00:39:42]** It's going to be a lot of tidy CSVs and then a parquet database to sort of handle most of each recording will have its data and mostly tidy formatted CSVs, you know, config yamls and then a parquet database to sort of handle, you know, a lot of the intermediate data just to keep each recording folder kind of cleaner and easier to use. As the new software is more sophisticated, it will also have more sort of, it'll be easier to add more complexity around like user, user input. So we'll in, in the past we've had it set up like you push the button and it goes and it kind of like it, it saves out pretty much the same thing for everybody every time. The new version will have more of a, like, you know, you can check the boxes. Oh, I want, I want this, I don't want that, you know, use you know, output in this format, not that format, you know, so tidy CSVs versus wide format CSVs is a thing that I have been introduced to as a thing to think about.

**[00:40:39]** And we're going to continue the general strategy of having sensible defaults for everybody. But we're going to start adding more actual like user settings and capacities to like make more choices if you, if you choose to. Oh, I see a goat's eye. Because it's. Yeah, no, because of the.

**[00:40:54]** Yeah, fair eyeballs are football shaped which does in fact look like goat eyeball, which is like rectangularly shaped. I say looking at the chat from some time ago. Jawas also have weird eyes, don't they? Cool. So, yeah.

**[00:41:08]** So as we transition as we're as we also, as we're going to be changing up the data model, I'm also going to want to start doing more kind of like public facing, kind of like request for comments. A lot of open source projects use these kind of enhancement protocols. So PEP is the classic one. So Pep 8 you may have heard of Python enhancement proposal I think is what that stands for. And so we're going to start trying to do something around scep so scaling enhancement proposals and the general sort of move there is like you, you, you know, you know, we in the, in the core maintainer team will make some post somewhere publicly in GitHub, sort of findable in various ways that says, hey, here's the plan, request for comments open for this amount of time and then sort of invite people to show up and have opinions about things other people like I'm talking about it now from sort of like a centralized way but you know, eventually people can come in from the outside and say, hey, I have an idea for a thing that we can do that.

**[00:42:08]** And then other people can post their own Scaling Hampshire proposals. And it's a way to sort of like invite community input without being like, what's the word? Locked down by the need to have like everything be a conversation in the commons, you know. So we post the proposal but we sort of keep it as kind of like a conversational space. We sort of have conversations about it, but ultimately the decision comes down to the core maintainers and ultimately those decisions come down to me.

**[00:42:36]** Another thing that probably should be written down in, you know, next year I'm gonna have to write a lot about the governance structure of freemo Cap for this NSF pose grant. So I'll get some of that written down, but in passing, freemo Cap is currently in the stage of what's called a bdfl, which stands for Benevolent Dictator for Life, which is a joke that was probably really funny in the 90s. It is the standard governance structure, structure of open source projects. Like someone like there's some person in the center that makes that ultimately, you know, makes the decisions. So Linus Torvald running Linux is the classic and BDFL is the simplest architecture, but it is also the most centralized and sort of, you know, problematic for a lot of a lot of other reasons.

**[00:43:22]** So I'm kind of proposing architect governance structure called BD Fast Potential, which stands for a benevolent dictator for a set period of time. I don't know exactly what that time would be, but the way I'm kind of thinking about it now is we've been doing this for five years. I think slash hope that in another five years it'll be in a good, it'll be a good time to start planning some sort of like this dissolution of centralized responsibilities. I am hoping that know five years from now, 2031, God bless us all if that. Around that time I'm hoping that the, the general community structure of freemo Cap will be such that like, you know, we can start having a governance structure and a sort of a conversation around the software that is not just like this guy saying stuff.

**[00:44:14]** Yes it is. These are the challenges. But. And the nice thing about the plan to have, you know, the benevolent dictator for a set period of time is that you're, you know, you're a dictator. So if five years happens and then I'm just like, oh, we're not ready yet, you know, you can't.

**[00:44:29]** Okay, we're going to push it out, we're going to push it out and if you don't like it, let's put it to a vote. This is my Syrian heritage coming in. It's like I know how to run elections. As a dictator, you just say it because it's, yeah, free Syria. We could free Syria.

**[00:44:44]** Death to tyrants. But not me just yet. Give me some time. There are models. So what's his name?

**[00:44:49]** Guido. Guido. The guy, the Python person had a. They. He stepped back.

**[00:44:54]** Taunt ton Roosenthal. A blender is. He's. There's some complex sort of transitional plan. I think he's, he might be out now, I can't remember, but he had a.

**[00:45:03]** He made an announcement. It's like I'm, I'm stepping back and there's a whole transition team that went on there. So, you know, we're not there yet. We don't. It's not a problem.

**[00:45:11]** Yeah. Tan is now officially the advisor, which is kind of, you know, it's like more of a. More of a big picture guy, you know. Like, I just, I. Not right now, but I really want to be, I aspire to be more of a big picture guy.

**[00:45:25]** And I think that, you know, a big part of Free mocap is, you know, so I have a certain set of skills as a research scientist, you know, whatever we want to say about that. And those skills were unique enough that it got me the fancy science science job and. Yeah. And I could, I could live a whole career being the guy that can do the thing, like the guy that can track the ferrite eyes the best or whatever. But a lot of free mocap.

**[00:45:49]** A lot of, like, the general philosophy of Free MOCAP is like, I kind of want to disseminate these. This skill set and this knowledge and whatever it is that sort of got me here broader and wider and better than you could from the ivory tower. And the way things are going, I think we're getting there. And so I. Right now, I think a big part of the reason why I still feel like the need to be the central guy is that Free mocap is at the intersection of so many different things that I just don't.

**[00:46:16]** It's. It's hard to really. It's hard to hand off work because, you know, again, I kind of built my career on living in the Venn diagram of different fields and sort of expertises and so. And Free MOCAP is the thing that I was able to build because of that sort of, like, positioning strategy that I took. And so disseminating those skills is hard and.

**[00:46:35]** But it's kind of like, it's the work that I'm doing and I've been doing, and I think it's going pretty well. So, again, my hope is that sometime, say in five years from now, because I am tired, there will be enough people around who have been doing it for long enough that like, you know, I could. I can. You know, it's already happening. Like, you know, your Phillips and your errands and your Andres are like, you know, every.

**[00:46:56]** Every unit of time, they, they. Their skill sets ratchet up. They're taking. They're, you know, making bigger decisions that are. They're running bigger, bigger pieces, bigger chunks.

**[00:47:07]** And that's going to continue and more people are going to sort of roll in and have fun and learn and get better, and we'll see. You know, you saw the nuclear war map. Like, we're. It's. It's whatever the hell it was that happened in that, you know, manic episode of 2020.

**[00:47:22]** This appears to be resonating at some level. Speaking of dissemination and education and blah, blah, blah, blah, another big project of the year is the documentation overhaul. And specifically, you know, rewriting a lot of the docs, you know, gearing them, you know, what exists, tuning it to version two and then just expanding the crap out of it. So I have been a professor, I for, you know, six years, whatever, many years now, and I've taught a lot of classes and the classes that I teach are sort of around this stuff. A lot of my classes are, you know, you can watch them on my YouTube channel, you know, if you're into that.

**[00:47:56]** But now that that sort of official academic ivory tower phase of life is sort of drawing to a close, I am ready to start, you know, thinking about how to sort of, you know, build more actual education and structure into the. Into the Freemo Cap sort of lifestyle or whatever or project like the Free mocap has always been at its core an educational project. Let's see. So wait, what am I trying to show here? Trying to show this.

**[00:48:22]** So I already have pushed a thing to. There's a repo. GitHub.com freemo cap university it is almost entirely, almost entirely AI generated. At this point, I found myself in a situation where I was like stuck in an airport for quite a long time. So I kind of like vibe coded this whole thing.

**[00:48:43]** So it's not like it was kind of like very long voice transcriptions type of stuff and like, like materials I already had. So it's, it's really fairly well tuned to like my actual. What it actually needs to be. But just saying don't go if it's AI slop in here. So don't get too.

---

### Chunk 6 [00:48:45 - 00:58:45]

**[00:48:45]** Like very long voice transcriptions type of stuff and like, like materials I already had. So it's, it's really fairly well tuned to like my actual, what it actually needs to be. But just saying don't go if it's AI slop in here. So don't get too excited about it. But the general structure is it going to be.

**[00:49:04]** Not that what do we look for? This is a good representation. So this as well as a little vibe coded sort of viewer. But the basic idea is going to be to like building a curriculum using both my experience running the project and also my experience as a college professor teaching students and have kind of a module based curriculum with micro certifications associated with it. So the idea would be that you'd have like a beginner class, this is sort of pretty similar to our current documentation and then sort of a more advanced, you know, Freemo CAP usage class, you know, 101, 101, 201 type of thing and then splitting out into kind of different subspecialties.

**[00:49:42]** So you know, if you want to focus on like you know, the three main sort of sections are the technology meaning mostly like development and you know, the core tools. So you know, skellycam, Skelly Tracker, skellyforge, Skelly Blender, Skelly core kind of so splitting up the curriculum around the technology according to the structure of the actual project and then also subspecialties under like the scientific route which is the basically like the, the scientific applications of FREEMO cap. So using a FREEMO CAP as a tool for studying perception, motor control, biomechanics, motor control, getting towards clinical applications, things like that. And then the third, third, third leg of the tripod I guess is the artistic route. So that's the animation and game designer stuff.

**[00:50:34]** Realistically this is the part that I personally know the least about. But there's a lot, I'm learning a lot every day and there's a lot of people in the community who would I'm sure be able to help out with that. So this is sort of the idea of I guess official unofficial announcement of the possibility of starting to work on this. The, the sort of like the Freemo Cap University approach which will basically involve slowly over time me adding new, basically fleshing out each little blob here. Each.

**[00:51:08]** Each.in this graph is intended to be kind of like a little short course and short course meaning like, like you know, like a lecture plus some sort of optional. To have micro certifications you have to have some kind of an Output So we can, we're going to, you know, like record like one of the things might be, you know, instructions on how to like record your own recordings. Then you can upload it to some server. It does some sort of internal checks of, you know, validating that your data is not bonkers. And then if you get it, then you get a little check mark and then you get the micro cert and then that's, you know, basically it's a badge you can put onto various places and you give you a little badge in this, in the Discord server and stuff like that.

**[00:51:46]** So this is something, it could take a good long time, but I think on the scale of, you know, a year, I would hope to have some, some success in chunking this out. There's also like, once you have a curriculum like this, there's, there's funding that you can get around that like, like this is fundable at some level or at least can be a component of a grant. So we'll see. Oh yeah, another announcement. So I feel like I've been teasing this for a while, but Skelly Bot coming soon to a server near you, optionally, if you're not into it.

**[00:52:16]** So this is like a project that I've been, I've been working on for years now, but it hasn't really made it much to like the forefront of like the free mocap conversation. Long story short, I have been since I think it was the summer of 22, I can't remember exactly, I've been building and deploying AI based teaching tools in my classrooms. And so I wound up teaching six total semesters. Use. Oh, this busted.

**[00:52:43]** Using this Skelly Bot repository. Skelly Bot is basically an AI chatbot that lives in Discord. The tech, the tech has shifted. I don't. Discord has never been the right tool for the job there.

**[00:52:53]** But the general strategies that I have learned around using AI in a teaching context and sort of like, like, like building educational structures around the use of AI that open up the possibility of teaching in ways that were just not possible beforehand. And a big part of it is like using the AI bot as kind of like a simulation of what it would be if you could do what everybody knows is the best, the best way to teach, which is mentor based self learning. Right. Sit down with an expert and they like hold your hand and tell you stuff. That's obviously the best way to learn stuff.

**[00:53:28]** But you can't really scale that out. So a lot of the teaching structures I did was based around like Me giving some sort of centralized lecture kind of thing, usually in a way that's super dense and super like way over the heads of the undergrads in the room and then using kind of the specifically prompted AI bot to kind of like give them the experience of what it would be like if I were able to sit down and talk with them specifically. Had a lot of really good success with that. And I think that that same kind of model of using the AI is sort of like the buffer layer between the one to many of teaching where there's like one professor like object and many, many student like objects. Having like the AI middle layer there to sort of smooth out that transition is something that I want to incorporate into this world of open source software because I think that the, the one to many problem, boy howdy, it shows up.

**[00:54:22]** And I think that in the world where we're trying to bring more people into the project who can contribute and sort of like find their space within like the pretty broad technical landscape that we cover, these kind of teaching tools I think can do really well. Um, so we'll see. Right now, trying to get to the point of feeling comfortable enough with the structure to just put it in the server. I think that there's a lot of what we would call RTFM questions that, that show up. No shade, but it happens a lot.

**[00:54:50]** There's a lot of questions people ask that the bot could answer pretty well. So there's a certain social aspect of like, how do we sort of integrate AI into a community space without it like feeling shoved in in an uncomfortable way and an unhelpful way. So I'm trying to be very careful around that. But it is sort of, you know, again, on the space of a year I would hope to have this shoved in. And minimally it's definitely going to be a part of the educational program here because I'm going to be applying the teaching strategies that I've developed to this free mocap university project.

**[00:55:23]** Where are we at? Getting close. Skelly. Shop Hoo boy. Talking about money, cash money, guys.

**[00:55:29]** So this is one of those things. In terms of the patchwork of potential income streams, this is, I'd say, you know, short term small potatoes, long term medium potatoes. The main thing now is that there is now shop.frmocap.org it does exist. You can use it. And specifically right now the main thing is it does.

**[00:55:50]** It does is that you can. Does it not show the two where isn't. Wait, wait, where's the other one? How do I see the second page. Am I blocking it?

**[00:56:04]** Okay, I don't know why that isn't showing up there. So this is. You can buy a Truico board.

**[00:56:15]** It is not, it's not this, we changed to the smaller one. But this, this is an older one. It's this size, so it's 18 by 24. So it's pretty, pretty solid. It's on the sort of corrugated plastic.

**[00:56:26]** This one just has the skelly head. But the one you order here has the full cheat sheet, which looks really nice blown up big. So it's kind of like you use the front of the board to calibrate it and then the back of the board to sort of teach you what you're actually doing and give you sort of helpful tips and advice. It's currently running through a print on demand service. So it's like expensive and slow and we don't make any money off of it.

**[00:56:47]** So I don't like that. So it costs $25. I think shipping winds up being like 10 or more. I don't, I don't know. And we don't, we don't make like.

**[00:56:55]** We don't make any money off of that. That's like breaking almost even. So I hate that it's expensive and I hate even more that it's expensive and then it's not. Not even getting, we're not even getting any money out of it. But it, but it does exist and that's the important part.

**[00:57:08]** And there are some, obviously, I think a lot of opportunities for more sophisticated systems. There's like, you know, like, if we just print them in bulk and then send them out ourselves, we can have a much different, you know, like the cost structure changes dramatically there. But then now you have like sort of more labor involved. This may be talking ahead of myself, but I'm sort of expecting to get connected to sort of a local like tech incubator, high school type of thing. And then, you know, people doing work, studying, stuff like that who can actually do the, the little manual labor there.

**[00:57:37]** So we're going to try to flesh this out. So I think currently this is a pretty good way to get a charcoal board. Like, I think we're competitive with what you would pay like a FedEx or a Kinkos or that type of thing. I have no idea what the landscape would look like internationally, but I'm speaking for America. And the.

**[00:57:54]** One of the more important pieces of work here is that the shop exists, it's connected to a bank, it's got Shopify, it runs and we're gonna, we're gonna keep working there. There's also again similar story. You can buy a seven dollar sticker but don't think that you're, you know we don't make any money off of this. This is, it's like the print on demand stuff is around it. Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:58:15]** Another ad has hit the stream, that's okay. But yeah, so we have, we do have this. You can now buy it. It's not it. We're getting, we'll get there.

**[00:58:24]** We'll get there one thing at a time. Yeah. And then so the other thing that the shop will eventually do is sell camera hardware. Camera hardware, extension cables, try little tripods, camera mouse, stuff like that. That's another thing that is going to take a little bit of time and sort of realistically would benefit from having you know, you know, some kind of captive audience of you know, low level labor.

### Chunk 7 [00:58:30 - 01:08:30]

**[00:58:30]** Hardware, camera hardware, extension cables, try little tripods, camera mouse, stuff like that. That's another thing that is going to take a little bit of time and sort of realistically would benefit from having you know, some kind of captive audience of, you know, low level labor. Because I tried to figure out a way to do it through just like drop shipping methods, but ultimately you just kind of don't have enough control over the camera. I wasn't able to quite figure out options that sort of felt good to be able to sell. So similarly for this, I think it would want to be something where we, we buy some stuff in bulk and we kind of package it out on our own and that for that situation, cameras get real cheap when you buy them in bulk.

**[00:59:12]** So especially these kind of. I don't know if I have any I can reach right now, but like the kinds of cameras we've been using in a lot of my daily life, I bought you know, in a pack of a hundred, pack of 100 for a thousand dollars. Oh, did I lose my video again? One second. Hello.

**[00:59:30]** Hello. Okay, we're back.

**[00:59:37]** Hello, we're back. Speaking of cameras. Yeah, so if you buy, if you buy cameras in bulk, they get really, really cheap per camera. And I think that it wouldn't be too hard to sort of find a source like you know, the right kind of factory in China to, to get, you know, large amounts of, of cameras, then sell them and then sell like packages for classroom settings, stuff like that. And I think that people would, people would be into that.

**[01:00:03]** And then once you have a system like that where you're, you're fulfilling the, the mission and having like the cheapest possible entry point for motion capture, then you can also sell better cameras, higher quality stuff, you know, higher cameras. Cameras go all the way up and all the way down. And a lot of people, there's people out there who would be willing to, who want the research cameras. Like the people who are building research labs are not actually trying to minimize cost. So that's kind of a part of the infrastructure that we're kind of like planning out.

**[01:00:31]** And yeah, you know, in the short term probably not going to make any like, like re, like actual like meaningful income out of that. But you know, while, while I'm trying to get the cheapest possible option onto the shop, it's much more of a community support thing. Like I'm just trying to find a way that y' all can get the stuff you need to do motion capture like as cheaply as possible. Like I don't want you to have to go to Amazon or you know, I think we could even do better than like AliExpress and stuff like that with the right kind of planning and then just taking the question marks out of it. And then, you know, I don't want to make money off of that layer of the community.

**[01:01:05]** But you know, once we have that set up, the people who are, who have more money to spend, you know, we can sort of have different arrangements there. We'll see. Where are we now? Ah yes, validation. One of the very exciting moments of freemocap history is coming up, which is Aaron Ol.

**[01:01:22]** Aaron Cherian is about to defend his dissertation in the next couple of months. Aaron has been working dutifully since day one really, I think doing like the, the really hard work of validating freemo Cap as a, as an actual clinical research tool. These are just kind of some, it's more placeholder than actual anything else. Just like here's here, let me dump all the data down. And so his dissertation is about using FreeMap, validating FreeMap as a clinical research tool.

**[01:01:53]** And he is soon to be sort of defending that. And then the idea that he's got this. Where'd he go? Did I lose again? Oh, oh, I know here I clicked too many times.

**[01:02:04]** There it is. So we have this. Oh, is that like he's been working out of this Primo Cap validation repository and that will be both kind of like a source of code and data and visualizations and documentation and then also kind of serve as like a white paper for the validation. So he's going to defend that. We're going to sort of, you know, clean it up for more public facing capacities, publish it in some kind of peer reviewed journal or another.

**[01:02:29]** And then once that's kind of working, then we're kind of ready for a new plan, a new, a new target which is, this is another kind. This is like a multi year target and that's to get free mocap FDA certified as a clinical research tool. 510k certification they call it currently. So the rules are that Primo Cap cannot be used. We can, we can call ourselves FDA certified as a research, as a research tool simply by putting this statement on here that says that it is not a clinical tool.

**[01:03:03]** Which is really funny to me. Basically the idea is that you, you just, you say this is certified as a research tool. It is not to be. Yeah, not cleared for clinical use. So not to be used in diagnosis, not to be used in treatment, stuff like that.

**[01:03:16]** So you can use it for Research publication, like that kind of thing. But you can't use it to like diagnose somebody with an illness or something like that. To get to FDA certification as a, as a clinical tool is a set of somewhat complicated. It's. It's some complicated stuff like it's federal, federal stuff and it involves a lot around the, the code like the software itself being to a certain point, the documentation being to a certain point and showing that it is possible for researchers in other places to, to use the tool and have reliable outputs from it.

**[01:03:53]** It's you know, FDA sort of like the rule, the ruling of the for stuff like this, for free stuff like female cap is that there are not really risks to the patient for using it, but there are patients because it's complex enough that there's a possibility of clinicians using it and getting like bad data and then having bad sort of decisions based off of that. That's the risk that they're concerned about, which honestly is super valid. So the, the work that Aaron has been doing for his validation for his dissertation is kind of step one towards this sort of longer term journey towards getting this FDA certification. Realistically, it's like that's again, that's the kind of thing you can write grants around. It's probably going to be like a multi year target to, to shoot for.

**[01:04:39]** But once we do get there then we're now actually like you could put us into hospitals and kind of like I've had this dream for a long time of like the, you know, the $500 gate lab. Like you usually like you don't get a gate lab in a hospital that doesn't have less than like, you know, five, six figures worth of funding and we could potentially build something that like you could put in, you could put in places that have really no resources and I don't know if you can think of any places that might be in the need of really low cost prosthetics fitting, but I certainly can. And this is something that you know, again you could pursue it in various levels. But you know, since we're talking about org level planning, we do want to target, you know like, like trying, like trying to like getting the federal certification I think is, is a target to be shooting for on the next, you know, n number of years, shall we say getting close. And then finally last but not least, the blender add on.

**[01:05:33]** The female cat blender add on. Which again Andres has been key and just key and critical for this and just doing really amazing work, you know. Yeah, if you, if you use Remote Cap at all. You've used the Blender add on and if you haven't, then you should because it's really cool. And the, the next sort of goal there is first of all we're going to transition the name.

**[01:05:55]** It's, it's. We're going to call it Transition, you know, transitioning to Skelly Blender so it fits the model. It's also kind of funny. And then the next target there is that there is a relatively small but sort of important list of things that have to be true that we'd have to hit to be able to be hosted in the official Blender extension. Oh sure.

**[01:06:16]** Come on man, we're not doing all that. So one of the things that happened with one of the, one of the more recent versions of Blender is that they've put out a unofficial extensions sort of repository where like single click install and I would love for FreeMailCap to be in there. So there's look not a ton but not horrible amount of work to be done to, to be able to be hosted there. And so that's going to be something we're shooting for and I believe that's it. So thank you to everybody who stuck around.

**[01:06:46]** It's always, you know, fun, kind of fun talking about plans, fun getting into it. I always feel a little just have to like get past the awkward. Like every so often you're like, I'm sitting alone in a room and then it's like, oh wait, no, there's people here. So it's Icon. Good to see you and Studio Golf.

**[01:07:02]** Good to see the names. Gonna see. Yeah, some of y', all, some of y' all been around for a long time. We've gone through, it's been. The world has, has gone through its paces and we are still here and we will continue to be here.

**[01:07:15]** Free mocap is a long term project, as you might be able to tell. Let's say, you know it. It was born out of a moral imperative that I sort of found for myself. A, you know, it's labor of love, you know, sort of necessary passion. People talk sometimes about like, people sometimes describe this as like a charitable activity and I guess technically, officially it is a charitable activity, but like it's not like I feel like I have a lot of other options, you know, like not.

**[01:07:42]** I mean I do have options but like this is, this is kind of like it just feels so much. It's just, it's the thing I should be doing, so I'm doing it and it's working out and it's not a, you know, a lot of people are around doing it. A lot of people helping. Community's growing. It's really, it's really great, really gratifying and exciting.

**[01:08:00]** And, yeah, it's like, it was like, what am I going to do, charge for it? That's insane. If I was going to charge for it, I would just stay a professor, you know, or go work for Google. When I talk to people about Free mocap, by far, by far, by far the most common thing that people say is, why is it free? You know, why is it free?

**[01:08:18]** What do you mean? Why aren't you charging for it? That's a thing of value. They say it's a thing of value. Why aren't you charging for it?

**[01:08:24]** But, you know, ultimately, one of the rules of free mocap is that.

---

### Chunk 8 [01:08:15 - 01:17:55]

**[01:08:15]** Is why is it free? You know, why is it free? What do you mean? Why aren't you charging for it? That's a thing of value.

**[01:08:20]** They say, it's a thing of value. Why aren't you charging for it? But, you know, ultimately, one of the rules of Free MOCAP is that anything that can be duplicated infinitely is. We don't charge for. So I don't.

**[01:08:37]** I can't imagine the ethical grounds of, like, just charging for a piece of binary code for charging for a pile of Python, you know, like, you know, by whatever strange quirks and twists of history and my talent and mentorship and training and whatnot that I've managed to receive, I, for whatever reason, you know, found myself with the ability to build a project like this and to teach other people how to build a project like this. And the idea of, like, there was a time when I would look at, like, the paid versions of Freemo Cap, like the move AIs and the Cocos and whatnot, and I was like, well, you know, no harm, no foul. But I radicalized a lot and I, you know, yes, harm, yes foul. You know, like, it's. It's just, I see that as like you're another person, whoever, another person, group of people who also have this, like, this, like, capacity to build this kind of thing.

**[01:09:32]** And then rather than giving it away, you leverage the. The distinction, that distance between you and the world around you to, like, suck money out of people. And it just. I don't like it and I don't support it. So, yeah, so we will free mocap.

**[01:09:47]** We seize the means and. And we see where it goes. Thanks. Thanks, Micah. And so then to that question, to the question of, like, you know, why is it free?

**[01:09:56]** I kind of. I've discovered a response to that. I've discovered a good answer, and that's. You just say it's a moral thing, and people go, oh, oh, I get that. I get morals because it's like, it short circuit the conversation.

**[01:10:10]** Because it's like everyone, you're living in this world of capitalism and people, I think you literally, you know, they say, oh, that's a thing of value. Why aren't things of value are based and you charge for that. That's how you survive in this horrifically idiotic structure where the base level human interaction is assumed to be competition. And so when you. So if you flip the question and you say, rather than asking, why is it free?

**[01:10:38]** Just. Just sort of start from the basis that it must be free and then ask the question of how are you going to support yourself? Building the thing that must be free. And. And I think that there's answers to that, and I think that we're finding them.

**[01:10:52]** And I think that a lot of it comes from, you know, understanding the value of your labor and charging for it. Charging and, you know, charging a lot, because that's what it's worth. I know the value of my work, it's high. And, you know, we'll see. We'll see.

**[01:11:09]** It seems at this point, you know, I'm not sure what our bus factor is right now, but I think it's pretty okay. I think it would be. It'd be a bummer, but I think we could survive a relatively unfortunate incident with a bus, possibly multiple buses, but I'm not sure about that. At least one bus. And.

**[01:11:27]** And, yeah, and we'll see. You know, I think. I think Close out, yo. It literally used to be called Open Mocap. There was a period of time where it was called Open Mocap.

**[01:11:38]** And I think there was some, like. There was some. Some. There was, like, a name conflict. Something else was called Open Mocap.

**[01:11:44]** And then I transitioned the name and 2. To quote brother Paul, Neo Next Death. I was like, I'm thinking about, like, Open Mocap versus Free Mocap. And. And he said, well, if I saw both of those next to each other, I would definitely go for Free Mocap first.

**[01:11:59]** And. Yeah, I think. I think that's correct. And it's like, you know, you're absolutely right. Open means something different now than it did five years ago.

**[01:12:08]** And I think if we. It's like, you know, it's like, if it was Open Mocap, we could charge for it without changing the name. And that feels wrong. With Free Mocap, it would. You have to change the whole name, change it to Fee Mocap.

**[01:12:22]** Someday. I have a dream about, like, having a version of Free Mocap, which is literally exactly the same, except it's called Fee Mocap. And Skelly's got, like, a monocle and a hat, and it just. You just charge $20 for it. It's like a way of giving a donation.

**[01:12:36]** And, like, everything is exactly the same, except that the Skelly Mesh is wearing a top hat with a monocle, and. And the logo says FEMA Cap. That's. We'll get there. Not yet.

**[01:12:46]** That's going to be. That's. That's down. Down the road a little bit. Okay.

**[01:12:50]** So I said I was going to talk for 45 minutes to an hour. I've been talking for an hour and a half. This is how I roll. But we'll end it here with this nuclear explosion, this sort of global. Global thermonuclear apocalypse of people building skeletons out of light in their living rooms.

**[01:13:10]** And, yeah, guess it's like, I see you. I see you there in the Faroe Islands. I see you doing your thing. Who knows? Look at the.

**[01:13:18]** Look at you in Oslo and Stockholm with your syndromes. Look at you in India. Who's this guy? Who are you? Right?

**[01:13:27]** Who are these guys? What are they doing? What are they building in there? You know? That's what I want to know.

**[01:13:32]** Thanks for not unchecking the box, guys. I like to see the dots. It really, truly, truly keeps me going to just kind of like, every so often, log and be like, holy shit. Holy. You guys are using it.

**[01:13:44]** Maybe someday I can go on, like, a Johnny Appleseed tour and just pick two blobs and then just, like, go there. Yeah. 10K, man. Yeah, I. I'm so glad I set up that ping thing, you know, it was a little bit of. It was.

**[01:13:58]** It felt weird to do any, like, data collection, but, like, boy, I don't. Man, it's hard to imagine. It's hard to imagine. I. I don't know. Like.

**[01:14:06]** I don't know. Look at them. Look at them there in Manila. Quazon. K Zone.

**[01:14:11]** I can't read that word. Yeah. If you make something for a community that doesn't have resources. No, that's not. It's not that.

**[01:14:20]** It's like, if you make, I don't know, people, like, free stuff. And I just feel like, you know, from a business perspective, like, if your user base is. If your cost is zero, then your user base is theoretically infinite. And in software money world, they. What they talk about, like, what's it called?

**[01:14:36]** It's like money per user. Like, price per user, resources per user, whatever it is. Dots are light in the darkness. I should do that. That would be nice.

**[01:14:44]** Oh, can I have that? Do I have that? Hold on. Oh, no. Oh, wait, no, I can still do it.

**[01:14:47]** There you go. See, that's nice also. Yeah. Some good contour maps, heat maps. I don't know how to make it go away.

**[01:14:54]** Anyways, I. Oh, that is. I agree. That's nicer. Shows up. Yeah.

**[01:14:59]** Okay. Oh, wait. Actually. Oh, Anyway. All right.

**[01:15:03]** Last call for comments then. I am. I'm gonna go pass out. I'm gonna. I feel like I say this every time I do a stream.

**[01:15:10]** I'm gonna try to stream more because I do, like, it. And it's fun and it's a good way to kind of like, you know, just think. I think with the project where it is now, the communication stage, it. It continues to be really important because I think the. The scale of the project is such that it would be easy from the outside to not realize that there's a lot of action here because it's.

**[01:15:29]** We move slow because we have a, you know, you know, the effort, low available effort. But I just think it's important to. Yeah. So having streams, having talk, you know, putting. Putting stuff out.

**[01:15:41]** Generally we get like. It's famous last words. I plan on stream more often as famous last words. And they're the last words I think of every single stream I've ever made. Someday it'll be true.

**[01:15:51]** Maybe. I guess. I guess that's not a guarantee. But someday it might be true. You never know.

**[01:15:55]** Okay, let me now let's play the game of let's figure out where to raid y' all to While I'm looking for a raid is a good time to say stuff if you want. But yeah. Thanks for watching. Thanks for. If you're watching this live or if you're watching this not live.

**[01:16:09]** Thanks for watching. Thanks for your interest. I don't know the science person. Chunky stuff. Yeah, let's kick you over here.

**[01:16:19]** That seems like a good choice. All right, now I go over. I know how to do this. I know how to do this. Oh yeah, Nikon's talking about fancy equipment.

**[01:16:28]** It is another thing that I haven't, I didn't mention. But the. As the core software stabilizes, it opens up more room to like have like non default options. So a big part of the work that's happening for V2, which I didn't mention, is like removing the necessity to use MediaPipe for everything and having the more hot swappable models. Like the Ferret stuff was built with deep Lab cut and then Aaron's been working with RTM pose and Vit Pose as.

**[01:16:57]** As options. So in the similar space of like making more generic make the software becoming more generic and able to handle more options. Weirdo. Fancy cameras is also kind of a part of that conversation. Like I still have all my 3D depth camera cameras and you know, stereo and you know, Kinect kind of cameras that would be so much fun to integrate into the free mocap thing.

**[01:17:20]** But I have not allowed myself to do it because it's like a sort of a. For, you know, specialized equipment is sort of forbidden. But you know, I think as things get easier to integrate. It'll be more possible to do that kind of thing. Because it's fun.

**[01:17:33]** Weird. Cameras are fun. Raid. Raid. Okay, go talk to this guy.

**[01:17:38]** I hope he's nice. And good talking to you guys. Have a nice night. Bye. Thanks.

**[01:17:44]** And then I think I have to wait 10 seconds. Yeah. Okay. And there it goes. Three, two, one.

**[01:17:50]** Oh. Now I click the button. Bye. Okay, now I have to figure out. Turn this off.
