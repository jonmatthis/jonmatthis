# FreeMoCap Movement-Building Worksheet
## Developing the Intellectual Infrastructure for Hegemonic Change

*Based on Jonathan Smucker's "Hegemony How-To" and political organizing theory*

---

# How to Use This Worksheet

This worksheet is designed for both individual reflection and group discussion. We recommend:

1. **Individual first pass:** Each core team member completes sections independently
2. **Compare and discuss:** Share responses and identify patterns, disagreements, tensions
3. **Synthesize:** Develop shared answers that represent collective understanding
4. **Revisit quarterly:** These questions aren't "solved" once—return to them as the project evolves

Set aside dedicated time. This isn't a 30-minute exercise—budget 2-3 hours for serious engagement with each major section.

---

# Part 1: The Hegemonic Vision

*"Hegemony" means making your values become the common sense of society. Before strategizing, get clear on what you're actually fighting for.*

## 1.1 The Current Common Sense

What do people in your target fields currently believe about motion capture? Complete these sentences as someone who has NEVER heard of FreeMoCap would:

**Researchers believe:**
> "To do serious motion capture research, you need ________________________________"

**Clinicians believe:**
> "Motion capture in clinical practice is ________________________________"

**Animators/creators believe:**
> "If I want motion capture for my project, I should ________________________________"

**Students/hobbyists believe:**
> "Motion capture is something that ________________________________"

**Where did these beliefs come from?** (institutions, companies, professional training, etc.)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 1.2 The New Common Sense

What do you want people to believe instead? Complete these as someone who has fully internalized FreeMoCap's vision:

**Researchers will believe:**
> "Motion capture is ________________________________"

**Clinicians will believe:**
> "In my practice, I can ________________________________"

**Animators/creators will believe:**
> "When I need motion capture, I ________________________________"

**Students/hobbyists will believe:**
> "I can ________________________________"

## 1.3 The Gap

Looking at the distance between current common sense and your vision:

**What must change for people to adopt the new common sense?**

| Category | What must change? | Who/what currently reinforces the OLD belief? |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Beliefs about cost | | |
| Beliefs about expertise required | | |
| Beliefs about quality/accuracy | | |
| Beliefs about who "deserves" access | | |
| Beliefs about what's "professional" | | |

## 1.4 Your Theory of Change

Complete this paragraph:

> FreeMoCap will shift common sense about motion capture by ________________________________. 
> The key leverage points are ________________________________. 
> We will know we're succeeding when ________________________________.

# Part 2: Public Narrative Development

*Marshall Ganz's framework: Story of Self → Story of Us → Story of Now*

## 2.1 Story of Self (Founder's Story)

*Why YOU, Jon? What in your life led you to this work? The goal is to connect your personal journey to universal values.*

**The Choice Point:** Describe a specific moment when you CHOSE this path. Not "I gradually became interested in..." but "I was standing in [place] when [thing happened] and I realized..."

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Challenge:** What obstacle or injustice did you witness or experience that made the status quo unacceptable?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Values:** What values drove your choice? (Not "I believe in open source" but deeper: fairness? democratization? the belief that knowledge belongs to everyone?)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Draft your Story of Self (3-4 sentences, conversational):**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 2.2 Story of Us (Community Identity)

*Who is the "we" of FreeMoCap? What shared experiences and values bind you together?*

**List the different constituencies who are or could be part of "us":**

```
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________
4. ________________________________
5. ________________________________
```

**What do these groups have in common?** (Not demographics—shared experiences, values, frustrations)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Complete this sentence that any FreeMoCap community member could say:**

> "We are people who ________________________________"

**What's OUR challenge?** (The shared obstacle we face together)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What's OUR hope?** (The shared vision that motivates us)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Draft your Story of Us (3-4 sentences):**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 2.3 Story of Now (The Urgent Call)

*Why NOW? What makes this moment critical? What opportunity will close if we don't act?*

**The Urgent Challenge:** What's happening RIGHT NOW that makes action necessary?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Closing Window:** What opportunity will we lose if we don't act soon?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Achievable Goal:** What specific thing can we accomplish if we act together now?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**The Specific Ask:** What do you want the listener to DO after hearing this story?

| Audience | Specific Ask |
|----------|--------------|
| Potential user | |
| Potential contributor | |
| Potential funder | |
| Institutional partner | |

**Draft your Story of Now (3-4 sentences):**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 2.4 The Full Narrative

Now weave them together. Practice telling this out loud—it should take 2-3 minutes:

```
[Story of Self]
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

[Bridge to Us]: "And I discovered I wasn't alone..."

[Story of Us]
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

[Bridge to Now]: "And now we face a critical moment..."

[Story of Now]
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

[The Ask]: "That's why I'm asking you to..."
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

# Part 3: The Clubhouse Audit

*Smucker's "political identity paradox": the cohesion that makes groups effective also isolates them. This section helps identify where FreeMoCap may be inadvertently exclusionary.*

## 3.1 Jargon Inventory

List terms that FreeMoCap uses that an outsider might not understand:

| Term | What it means | Accessible alternative |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Markerless | | |
| Pose estimation | | |
| Charuco board | | |
| Skelly/SkellyTracker | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Review recent Discord/GitHub conversations. What terms appear frequently that might confuse newcomers?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 3.2 Implicit Norms

What does someone need to KNOW to participate in FreeMoCap that isn't written down anywhere?

| Category | Implicit knowledge required | How could we make this explicit? |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Technical skills | | |
| Tools/platforms (Git, Discord, etc.) | | |
| Communication norms | | |
| Decision-making processes | | |
| Social dynamics (who to ask, etc.) | | |

## 3.3 The Newcomer Experience

**Imagine someone who:**
- Has heard of FreeMoCap for the first time
- Is interested but has no open source experience
- Has a potential use case but isn't sure if FreeMoCap is right for them

**Map their journey:**

| Step | What happens now? | Pain points? | How to improve? |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Discovers FreeMoCap (where/how?) | | | |
| Tries to understand what it does | | | |
| Tries to install/use it | | | |
| Encounters a problem | | | |
| Tries to get help | | | |
| Considers contributing | | | |
| Makes first contribution | | | |

## 3.4 Who's NOT Here?

**Look at your current community. Who is missing?**

| Group that SHOULD be interested | Why aren't they here? | What barrier might they face? |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

**Uncomfortable question: Is there any way that current community culture might actively repel certain people?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 3.5 The Insider Test

Ask a current core contributor to answer honestly:

> "What do you wish someone had told you when you first encountered FreeMoCap?"

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

> "What almost made you give up or leave?"

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

# Part 4: Organizing vs. Mobilizing Assessment

*Jane McAlevey's distinction: Mobilizing activates existing supporters; Organizing expands your base by bringing in people who don't yet see themselves as part of the movement.*

## 4.1 Current State Assessment

**Who currently participates in FreeMoCap?** (Be specific about backgrounds, how they found you)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**How did they find FreeMoCap?** (What channels, who referred them, what were they searching for?)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What do current participants have in common?** (Background, values, skills, demographics)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Honest assessment: Are you primarily reaching people who are ALREADY:**
- [ ] Interested in open source?
- [ ] Technically skilled in Python/programming?
- [ ] Connected to academic research?
- [ ] Part of maker/hacker culture?

*If you checked most of these, you may be mobilizing rather than organizing.*

## 4.2 The Organizing Target

**Who would benefit from FreeMoCap but doesn't know it exists or doesn't see it as "for them"?**

| Constituency | What would they gain? | Why don't they know about/use FreeMoCap now? |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

## 4.3 Organic Leaders

*McAlevey's concept: "Organic leaders" are people deeply respected within their own communities who can bring others along. They're not already activists—they're people with social capital in target constituencies.*

**For each target constituency, who are the organic leaders?**

| Constituency | Who do people in this group listen to? | Do you have any connection to them? |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Biomechanics researchers | | |
| Physical therapists | | |
| Animation/game dev educators | | |
| High school STEM teachers | | |
| Dance/movement communities | | |
| | | |

**Concrete question: Can you name 3 specific people (not types of people) who could open doors to new constituencies?**

```
1. ________________________________ (constituency: _______________)
2. ________________________________ (constituency: _______________)
3. ________________________________ (constituency: _______________)
```

## 4.4 Bloc Recruitment Strategy

*Rather than recruiting individuals one-by-one, can you recruit existing GROUPS?*

**What organized groups could become FreeMoCap adopters/partners?**

| Type of group | Specific examples | Who would you contact? | What would you offer them? |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| University labs | | | |
| Professional associations | | | |
| Educational programs | | | |
| Maker spaces | | | |
| Clinics/practices | | | |
| Online communities | | | |

# Part 5: Core and Base Structure

*Every movement needs both: a committed CORE that provides direction and capacity, and a broader BASE that participates at varying levels.*

## 5.1 Mapping Your Current Structure

**Who is currently in the CORE?** (Regular contributors, decision-makers)

| Name | Role/contribution | Time commitment | How long involved? |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Is this enough people for sustainability?** 

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What functions are UNDERSTAFFED in the core?**

| Function | Currently handled by | Ideal: who should own this? |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Technical development | | |
| Documentation | | |
| Community management | | |
| User support | | |
| Outreach/partnerships | | |
| Fundraising | | |
| Education/tutorials | | |

## 5.2 Levels of Engagement

**Design a ladder of engagement—how do people move from casual user to core contributor?**

| Level | Description | What they do | How many do you have? | How many do you need? |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1: Aware | Knows FreeMoCap exists | Follows on social media | | |
| 2: User | Uses the software | Downloads, runs | | |
| 3: Active User | Regular user, gives feedback | Files issues, asks questions | | |
| 4: Contributor | Occasional contribution | PRs, docs, support others | | |
| 5: Regular Contributor | Consistent participation | Multiple contributions/month | | |
| 6: Core | Owns a domain | Leads working group, decision-making | | |

**What are the BARRIERS between each level?** (Why don't people move up?)

```
Level 1→2: _________________________________________________________________
Level 2→3: _________________________________________________________________
Level 3→4: _________________________________________________________________
Level 4→5: _________________________________________________________________
Level 5→6: _________________________________________________________________
```

## 5.3 Non-Code Contributions

**List all the ways someone could contribute WITHOUT writing code:**

```
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________
4. ________________________________
5. ________________________________
6. ________________________________
7. ________________________________
8. ________________________________
```

**Are these pathways clearly documented and promoted?** [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Partially

**For each, is there a named person who could mentor/onboard new contributors?** [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Some

# Part 6: Governance and Decision-Making

*Explicit governance enables participation. Implicit governance excludes.*

## 6.1 Current State (Be Honest)

**How are decisions currently made in FreeMoCap?**

| Decision type | Who decides? | What's the process? | Is this documented? |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Technical direction | | | |
| Feature priorities | | | |
| Release timing | | | |
| Community policies | | | |
| Partnerships | | | |
| Spending/resources | | | |
| Who becomes a maintainer | | | |

**If someone wanted to propose a significant change, what would they do?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**If there's a disagreement, how is it resolved?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 6.2 Governance Design

**What governance structure would serve FreeMoCap's mission?**

Consider:
- How democratic should decision-making be?
- What decisions should be made by whom?
- How do new people gain decision-making power?
- How do you balance efficiency with inclusion?

**Draft a simple governance document:**

```
FREEMOCAP GOVERNANCE (DRAFT)

Mission: _______________________________________________________________

Values: 
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________

Decision-Making:
- Day-to-day technical decisions are made by: ____________________________
- Feature priorities are decided by: _____________________________________
- Community policies are decided by: ____________________________________
- Major strategic decisions are decided by: ______________________________

Becoming a Maintainer:
_________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________

Conflict Resolution:
_________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________
```

## 6.3 Working Groups

**What working groups would help distribute leadership?**

| Working Group | Purpose | Potential Lead | Current Status |
|---------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Core Development | | | |
| Documentation | | | |
| Community | | | |
| Outreach/Partnerships | | | |
| Education | | | |
| | | | |

---

# Part 7: Strategic Priorities

*Time to synthesize. What are the MOST IMPORTANT actions based on this analysis?*

## 7.1 Force-Ranked Priorities

Look back at everything above. What are the TOP 5 priorities for the next 6 months?

| Priority | Why this matters | First concrete step | Who owns this? |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |
| 4. | | | |
| 5. | | | |

## 7.2 The One Thing

If you could only do ONE thing from this worksheet, what would have the biggest impact?

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Why?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What would "success" look like in 6 months?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 7.3 What You're NOT Going to Do

*Strategy is as much about what you don't do as what you do.*

**What should FreeMoCap explicitly DEPRIORITIZE for now?**

```
1. ________________________________ (Why: _______________________________)
2. ________________________________ (Why: _______________________________)
3. ________________________________ (Why: _______________________________)
```

---

# Part 8: Personal Reflection (For Core Team Members)

*Smucker asks: "How many times had I favored a particular action because I really thought it was likely to change a decision-maker's position or win over key allies, as opposed to gravitating toward an action because it expressed my activist identity?"*

## 8.1 Expressive vs. Strategic

**Be honest with yourself. In the last month, how much of your FreeMoCap work was:**

| Category | % of time |
|----------|-----------|
| Work that directly advances the mission (growing users, improving accessibility, building power) | |
| Work that feels good but isn't strategically necessary (perfecting code, interesting technical problems, internal community stuff) | |
| Maintenance/necessary overhead | |

**What's one thing you do because it expresses your identity as [developer/academic/open source person] rather than because it advances FreeMoCap's mission?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 8.2 Your Role

**What is your unique contribution to FreeMoCap?** (What would be lost if you left?)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What do you do that SOMEONE ELSE could/should be doing?** (What should you delegate to grow others?)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**What's burning you out?** (What's unsustainable about your current involvement?)

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

## 8.3 Development

**What skill or capacity do you need to develop to be more effective?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
```

**Who could help you develop this?**

```
_____________________________________________________________________________
```
