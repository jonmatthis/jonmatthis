  - Why are you spending your energy on this? 
    - *Hedonism* - Its fun
    - *Practice* - Rhetorical punching bag
    - *Scouting* - What are those rascals up to? 
    - *Audience* - Are there convincible people watching?
  - "We get to choose who we have these conversations with"
- Option C - Employ cult deprogramming techniques
  - Engage with curiosity, compassion, and a TRUE desire to understand
  - Let them speak and seek to understand their position
  - Try to get them to follow each thought to its conclusion
    - Seek mis-match between their core moral beliefs
    - Try to get them to reach the conclusion WITHOUT triggering defensiveness
