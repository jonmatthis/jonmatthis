# Responding to Hasbara


---

### **Option A:** Don't! 
> **"Never argue with a zionist"** 
> - *my mom, speaking from experience*

- **It's what they want!**
- **They don't deserve your time and energy**
- **Stalemates favor the Status Quo**
   - The [Bullshit Assymmetry Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law) and the [Gish Gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) Trap 
- **Its not effective**
  -  [The emotional dog and its rational tail](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11699120/)
  - The [Backfire effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7462781/)

### **Option B:** Be strategic and engage *intentionally*
> "We get to choose who we have these conversations with"
  
- If you choose to engage, be intentional about WHY
- Why are you spending your energy on this? How does this help Palestine?
  - **Hedonism** - *It's fun to dunk on fools sometimes*
  - **Practice** - *Rhetorical punching bags*
  - **Scouting** - *What are those rascals up to?*
  - **Audience** - *Are there any on-the-fence people watching?*

- **Option C**: Cult deprogramming techniques
  > Look up `Daryl Davis`
  - Engage with curiosity, compassion, and a TRUE desire to understand
  - Let them speak and seek to understand their position
  - Try to get them to follow each thought to its conclusion
    - Seek mis-match between their core moral beliefs
    - Try to get them to reach the conclusion WITHOUT triggering defensiveness
