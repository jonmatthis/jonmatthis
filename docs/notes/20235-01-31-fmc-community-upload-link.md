[[:skelly_joy: Share Your FreeMoCap Feats  :skelly_joy:

Hey everyone! Got a cool FreeMoCap recording you want to show off? We've created a Media Upload Form where you can share your creations and animations. 

[INSERT FINAL LINK TO FORM HERE]

We’re gearing up for a big conference (see below!) in a couple of weeks — and as we head into this event (and beyond), it’s extremely helpful to feature demos and visualizations made by the community!

Your submissions aren't just for cool visuals - they help us highlight the real-world impact of free, open-source motion capture as we attract collaborators and funding, showing how FreeMoCap can support researchers, artists and tinkerers alike.

We’ve also specified privacy-friendly options, so you can share as much or as little as you’d like.
Thanks for helping us out!

p.s. The conference in question is the 2025 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) in San Diego from Nov 15-19. We'll be in Exhibitor Booth #3704 (near the NIH/NSF booth) - Come say hi!]]
