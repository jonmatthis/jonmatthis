# FreeMoCap Paid Services

>**Knowledge is Free, Labor is unbelievably expensive**
>
>FreeMoCap Foundation paid services policy: 
>- Anything that can be duplicated infinitely is free (i.e. code, videos, documentation, etc)
>- Anything that cannot be duplicated infinitely costs money (i.e. labor, cloud services, physical equipment (cameras, charuco board, etc))

## Dedicated Support
- pay a set fee for a set # hours/month of dedicated support. Basically allows DMs with Philip-like-objects for set up, install, analysis, etc, with support beyond the stochastic responses you can expect from the public server 
 
## Dedicated setup
- pay a flat fee for us to help you set up your recording setup, including purchasing support and camera setup. Can be handled remotely, or pay premium to fly someone in to do it in person. 

## Dedicated training
- Organized training in (free) mocap basics, including follow ups. Also can be handled remotely or in-person

## Research/Project planning
- meeting with fmc crew to plan out a project, including plans for equipment, space, milestones, contingency, etc. First meeting is more expensive (because I'm there for it), follow-ups cheaper

## Feature request
- client requests some feature that doesn't exist yet, which we then fast-track in order to get it finished sooner than it would have otherwise (e.g. support for a particular camera, tracker, etc)
