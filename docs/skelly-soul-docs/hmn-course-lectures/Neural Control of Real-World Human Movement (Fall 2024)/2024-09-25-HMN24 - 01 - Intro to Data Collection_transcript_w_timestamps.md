### Chunk 1 [00:00:00 - 00:09:59]

**[00:00:00]** Hello. We're recording now. Spectacular. But that's not. I mean, so, yeah, FMRI is great, kind of.

**[00:00:09]** I have doubts, but it is, like, the best tool that we have for looking inside of a person's brain without opening it up. There's also things like eeg. There's also stuff like fnirs. I don't really like or trust any of those either, because they're all just so abstracted away from the thing that we actually hypothetically care about, which is the desideratum. Desideratum.

**[00:00:35]** Desideratum. The desideratuh of the kind of research that's multiple. The desideratum of a given research area is the thing that you want to know. Why did you come here? Why'd you show up?

**[00:00:49]** What's your goal? That is the desideratum of the field of inquiry. And I would argue that the field of neuroscience is largely designed to help us understand what the hell this is. Like, this stuff, right? I left my house, got on a bike, did a bunch of this.

**[00:01:14]** Somehow my dinner from last night fueled the energy cost somehow. And now I'm here and I'm talking to you, and I'm telling you that that happened.

**[00:01:27]** And a lot of the scientific world that we live in this sort of has this very reductionist feel and sort of underlying philosophy of reductionism where the goal is to measure things with increasing precision at finer and finer levels, with the hopes that we'll someday get to the bottom of it and figure it all out. And so because of that, it's kind of somewhat by necessity of technology and somewhat by, you know, sort of feedback loops driven there.

**[00:02:00]** The tools that we use to measure research often come at the cost of the ecological validity of the data. Meaning that you're putting me in a tube and shooting big magnets at my head and saying, oh, look at what your brain is doing. That tells me something about you out in the world over evolutionary time and over the course of your day. And it does to some extent, because you're measuring the same engine that's driving the behavior when I'm out doing stuff. But you're getting a very precise measurement of the thing doing something different from the thing that you actually care about, which is behaving out in the real world.

**[00:02:42]** Right? So it's kind of. There's often a trade off. In fact, there's perhaps necessarily a trade off between empirical precision and God in heaven and ecological validity.

**[00:03:02]** One second, I got this.

**[00:03:06]** So if we can't record what's going on in my brain because it's unfortunately 2024 and we just can't do that yet. And some people will say, oh no, you can put EEG on people, you can do FMRI on people. And it's like, yeah, you can. But I don't. But yeah, let me rephrase that.

**[00:03:28]** No you can't. But a lot of people believe that you can and we respect their efforts.

**[00:03:36]** So if we are talking about trade offs between empirical precision and ecological validity, anytime there's a trade off, there's often two sides to that. So I'd say all the way. On the farthest side of empirical precision reductionist philosophy is the E phys measurements. That's like you're sticking an electrode into the goop itself and looking at how it's spiked and you get unbelievably precise measurements, typically on non human animals. But sometimes you get to do that.

**[00:04:09]** But in those situations, in particular, the animal or whatever that you're. Well, it's always an animal, human or non human animal is never doing anything particularly interesting. It's just usually attached to something because the technology requires it. There are new technologies coming online that allows animals to move around as they're being measured. And I'm like working on some of those things with some people.

**[00:04:36]** But those are new types of studies, new types of tools, new types of equipment.

**[00:04:44]** An alternative approach is to say, let's go the other way and let's just measure the behavior as closely as we can to the desired. The desideratum, the sort of, the case study, the ecologically valid measurements, the ecologically valid behaviors. Let's record those as well as we can and then we can make inferences about what's going on in the inner parts, the hidden variables, the parts that we can't actually measure directly. And if we're lucky, then the people who are out there cracking open skulls and taking like electrical recordings will share their notes and they can say, oh, hey, we found this part and that part and we think this does this other thing. And I can say, oh, I saw this behavior and that behavior and those two things kind of line up.

**[00:05:27]** These things don't, but those things do. And in a perfect world we all get to do nice, good, happy research, end of class, we're done.

**[00:05:44]** But yeah, no, unfortunately it's actually slightly more complicated than that.

**[00:05:59]** Yeah.

**[00:06:02]** So let's sort of for the moment put the reductionists to the side. There's more than enough of them. They're very well funded, they'll be fine. And let's work on this other part where we try to figure out that thing I said before where I was like, you just measure the real behavior and then you study that and you're good to go. It turns out that part also quite difficult.

**[00:06:26]** And you saw in that lab some of the big fancy tools that we use to do that. And it measures the environmental forces. Excuse me for pushing into your space.

**[00:06:43]** Yeah. So we can measure things like movement, we can measure things like forces. We use these big fancy tools to do it.

**[00:06:55]** Actually, you want to help me out? But. Yeah, yes. Go ahead and start setting things up. Just free mocap it regular and I'll keep blathering about stuff.

**[00:07:13]** Do you have it on here? Yeah, no, I got it.

**[00:07:23]** That's why I was late. I was like, oh, it's been a while since I've used that computer to do anything.

**[00:07:30]** And I'm going to move this up.

**[00:07:41]** Do we know how to raise that thing?

**[00:07:46]** It's probably over here. Cam privacy control.

**[00:07:53]** I don't see anything obvious. Oh, it might be stupid and just. Is it just a manual? Well, unlikely, but it might be like, pull it down and it comes up. Oh, maybe it's got the thing on it.

**[00:08:09]** No, it's probably powered. It might be like, it turns it off when this thing turns off.

**[00:08:17]** It's fine. We'll figure it out. That's good enough for no.

**[00:08:24]** Oh, yeah. And also turn this off. Yeah. So this is connected, but because it's being being held by obs, these things turn off. So there's an order of operations that you have to do.

**[00:08:44]** If it's like, if you. If you turn obs on and it grabs that camera, then you can do freemo cap. And it only sees these. Otherwise it. It gets weird.

**[00:08:53]** Okay, so as I mentioned, I spent a lot of my time over the past half decade or so messing with cheap cameras because I had a whole crisis of conscience around how freaking expensive that lab was. And even if I wasn't like, morally perturbed by it, I hate that equipment. It's garbage. That software is the worst in terms of physical measurement. Apparati.

**[00:09:18]** Spectacular. The force plates are great, the cameras are very fast and precise, but the software is abysmal and it's super duper duper expensive. And even if it wasn't, it like, sucks to use. And there's a lot of manual effort, manual labor. It's basically 90s tech, which I haven't been doing this since the 90s, but I have been doing this since that was less of a digit and.

**[00:09:50]** Yeah, so cool. Nice. So, also, there's been a lot of technological advancements since the 90s.

---

### Chunk 2 [00:09:45 - 00:19:44]

**[00:09:45]** Dig and yeah, so cool. Nice. So also there's been a lot of technological advancements since the 90s and a lot of them has focused on these weird objects. This is called camera. Cameras measure light.

**[00:10:12]** Light is trying to get a sense of. I might have to take my shoes off because they're. Yeah, I'll take, I'll do it later.

**[00:10:28]** Oh yeah, right.

**[00:10:32]** So basically, long story short, so this is free mocap and it's a free open source markerless motion capture system that works in conceptually very similar way to the big fancy space in the lab. Did you guys see that? I show you like the 2D views with the intensity. See like you move the thing around, it's like, oh, look at those dots on the screen. And then they get triangulated.

**[00:10:57]** Remember because of triangles, mostly triangles.

**[00:11:05]** And then you get the 3D information based off of that. So those old systems, I say old, the traditional marker based motion capture system basically constrains the world that it's measuring. To make it easier to measure. You put a marker like a dot, specially designed dot that uses retro reflective stuff, which is like the things on your shoes which have interesting optical properties. And you put those on the person on the thing that you're trying to measure.

**[00:11:37]** And that thing is designed to work with the cameras, to make the cameras able to track that thing in 2D. And then there's a bunch of fancy secret expensive software doing 20,000 2 to 3,000 year old math to figure out where that dot is in space.

**[00:12:00]** So again you kind of have that theme where you're constraining the world a bit to make it easier to measure. In the FMRI and the E Phys world, you constrain the behavior by telling the person not to move. You constrain the behavior by like removing the skull from the thing that's getting in the. Because the low electrodes are wimpy. But you're changing the thing that you're measuring in order to make it easier to measure by necessity, because of the.

**[00:12:35]** That's probably good.

**[00:12:43]** And there's typically kind of like a trade off there. Like as a general rule, the more you constrain the environment that you're measuring, the easier it is to measure because you are exerting your. Like you're looking at the thing and you're saying I'm going to make this easier for myself. And that typically works if you're good at what you're doing. But you also wind up affecting the thing that you're trying to measure.

**[00:13:08]** And that may or May not matter for the desideratum of the research that you're trying to do.

**[00:13:16]** So, for example, if I was trying to do the traditional mocap thing, I have to bring people into the lab. So that's its own kind of difficulty. I have to put them in the spandex suit. I have to put the dots on them. I have to calibrate the room.

**[00:13:30]** All these things may or may not matter, but I had to do that for a long time because that was the only way to get a camera to track an object in two dimensions. And nowadays we have other ways of doing that. So I'm going to go through a bit of a process right now, and in what will be a recurring theme, just going to move this over there so I don't trip on it and kill myself.

**[00:14:02]** This is going to be one of those things where it's going to make more sense later, what's happening. Because ideally, if it all works out, we're going to use this data for the rest of the semester and sort of look at it and try to understand what's going on and try to sort of get a sense of how we can use measurements of what happened in the past to make inferences about what may or may not be going on in the meat in the goop on the basis of the measurements we managed to get. Because I'm going to go out here in a second. It's going to take. I'm not like that.

**[00:14:40]** But there's a whole process.

**[00:14:49]** I guess we can turn off the projector when it's ready to go, or we can turn it to that.

**[00:14:59]** It probably won't pick up.

**[00:15:06]** Yeah. Could you maybe just tune it so it. Yeah, that one might even want to go, like behind those desks or something.

**[00:15:22]** Yeah. Because one of the realities is that if I wanted to know about what. Let's say it was Michael who was moving the triangle around, and I wanted to know something about what. Like, what were the motor commands that were going to his muscle parts?

**[00:15:46]** My ability to answer that question is dependent on what I managed to record. Like the true fact answer of that question of what were the motor commands that were sent. That information is dead and gone, fuzzed off into the past. It went to the same place that the DOT data went after you didn't record it. And you can never get it back.

**[00:16:10]** It dissolves into the foam of whatever happens with when time goes forward.

**[00:16:21]** What that means is that the actual moment of recording is very, very important. This is the moment all this data is Going away because we're not recording it because I didn't click the big red button. But when I do, that will be the only record that we have of whatever was going on. And we're going to try to use it to understand what was going on in this weird goopy thing. The two weirdest things in the universe are light and human behavior.

**[00:16:55]** And we're going to try to use the one to understand the other. Basically impossible, but we can approximate it iteratively over time.

**[00:17:09]** Okay, let's see.

**[00:17:14]** Yeah, could you, like, tilt them down and center this one? Just a little bit less height. Sorry. Thank you. And.

**[00:17:26]** Yeah, that's right. Okay, right. I forgot. Like, angles matter here. And try to get it, like, straight.

**[00:17:35]** Like this. Straight, if you can. Yeah.

**[00:17:41]** So this is because this is the part you can't do again, except that you can. You can do it again. I can just record myself twice. But this is the moment of transduction. Transduction is a great word that means when energy changes from one form to another.

**[00:17:59]** In this particular case, light is going through the lens, bending, hitting a sensor, which is a weird rectangle, and being transformed into a pattern of electrical impulses. If that sounds familiar, it's because that's what you are. Let's do what you do, at least in this rough region. Your eyes are not cameras, but there are similarities at some level.

**[00:18:27]** And so, yeah, so we're going to be measuring rectangles of light. We're going to be measuring three rectangles of light, taking samples from three light cones from three locations, and we're going to be pulling one measurement of light intensity at three wavelengths. R, G, and B, red, green, and blue, 30 times per second from three devices. Actually, we don't know the device's location, unfortunately, we're going to try to guess later, by cheating and measuring something, that we know what the answer is. This is called calibration.

**[00:19:13]** And then we're going to guess what the location of those devices were. And then we're going to look at the rectangles of colors. We're going to call them colors, even though it's pretty abstract, and then try to go from there down some strange epistemic path with various forms of computation and math, most of which you will not have to worry about because it'll all happen very quickly. And then try to make inferences about.

---

### Chunk 3 [00:19:30 - 00:29:29]

**[00:19:30]** Down some strange epistemic path with various forms of computation and math, most of which you will not have to worry about because it'll all happen very quickly. And then try to make inferences about what brains do. Central nervous systems. Really cool.

**[00:19:57]** Yeah, thanks. What's that?

**[00:20:02]** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**[00:20:10]** I guess I'll calibrate first and then I'll sort of make a plan.

**[00:20:16]** SV8 looking there.

**[00:20:21]** Alright, shoes are coming off. I apologize, but this will not be the last time I'm taking my shoes off because my shoes are black and my socks are white and the ground is dark and we care about where my feet are. So we're measuring light, remember, like we're not measuring feet, we're measuring light and then we're inferring feet. So we're going to make our job a little bit easier by putting these things there. If I cared about the grippiness of these shoes, this would be a mistake in terms of this experiment.

**[00:20:58]** But I don't care about the grippiness of shoes. So this manipulation of reality I think is forgivable.

**[00:21:13]** It's always the feet. And okay, so if you recall, we're going to measure, we're going to record stuff from cameras, right? There's subtle hints in the environment that that's what's going to happen.

**[00:21:29]** This guy follows me if I ask him nice. Good job. That's a two axis gimbal. You have a three axis gimbal. You have two of them right here.

**[00:21:45]** We'll talk about that later.

**[00:21:49]** So we're going to be recording from the cameras. The cameras measure light. We talked about that. We're going to want to know where the cameras are. That's going to be pretty important because we're going to be trying to measure space.

**[00:22:00]** And so we're going to do a thing we call calibration, which is basically a fancy word for trying to measure where all the cameras are relative to each other. So the way that we do that is we cheat because later we're going to record something that's a weird, unknown, goopy, wobbly object, one of these. And that thing's going to be really hard to measure. And so the first thing we want to do is confirm to ourselves that the tool is actually doing what we think it's doing. And so we're going to cheat by measuring something where we know the answer to the question.

**[00:22:37]** This is a grid. See all the squares? The squares are 58 millimeters on a side. You can see I wrote that right there. Obviously you can see that from the back.

**[00:22:49]** And it's got these little patterns here that are custom made to be easy to track by cameras. So we're going to start by showing all the cameras this friendly calibration object. And then they're going to use that and sort of infer well, based off math that a combination of me and tens of thousands of my closest friends wrote over the past 30 to 40 years or so, based off math that we've been doing for thousands of years. And the result of that will be an estimate about the location of each camera measured in the 6 degree of freedom estimate of where the cameras are. Six degrees of freedom means that there's six numbers involved, three positions, XYZ and three rotations.

**[00:23:34]** X, Y, Z. With position and rotation, you can measure the location and rotation of rigid body in space. But don't worry about that. It won't be on the test. There won't be a test.

**[00:23:45]** You'll just let it wash over you. Okay.

**[00:23:53]** Yeah, like there's a spot. I think we shut the projector off.

**[00:24:03]** Okay.

**[00:24:07]** There was like a white bar across this from the projector and that. It tends not to like that.

**[00:24:16]** Oh, I lied.

**[00:24:28]** Oh, that was so graceful. I can leave it up there. So the next person who's shorter than me will just be screwed. No, we won't do that.

**[00:24:43]** Okay, so once I calibrate them, you and you don't touch that camera. You don't touch that camera. Nobody touch any cameras. Deal. Great.

**[00:24:55]** Because if you do have to do this again. Okay.

**[00:25:01]** I guess it's not. I don't know about how. Yeah. Do you want to. I guess we have another spotlight too.

**[00:25:13]** Is it around? Is it. Is it available? Yeah.

**[00:25:22]** Yeah. You might as well.

**[00:25:29]** Let's see. Yub, yub, yub. Is there a plug on this side of the room anywhere? No.

**[00:25:46]** Nope.

**[00:25:51]** Did I? Yeah. Let's don't eat that.

**[00:26:02]** I'm going to write out stuff that we're going to do. Basically just feed the cable as far as it'll go.

**[00:26:11]** The last time I recorded data in class, it became the test data for this project for like two years. So I'm not saying that's what we're going to do now, but I have learned over the course, course of my life that. Oh, there's no plug over here either. How does anybody plug anything in in this world?

**[00:26:37]** Oh, yeah, that's not going to make it that far, but that's fine. Better than nothing.

**[00:27:02]** 12:38. Okay.

**[00:27:06]** So when I actually get to the point of recording stuff, I'm going to stand, do a range of motion, do a lean, do a one foot stand.

**[00:27:27]** Then I'm gonna do this separately. That'll be that. And then we'll do another one where I do lean and one foot stand one with the kettlebell. Writing this down. Don't.

**[00:27:45]** It's not important. Yeah, it's not. This is for me. And then I'm going to do another one where I jump times 10 and then big jump.

**[00:28:00]** Great.

**[00:28:03]** It is a known effect if you have anything that has a record button when you push record, your cognitive facilities go. So you need to do everything you can to externalize thoughts before you push the record button.

**[00:28:21]** So just kind of taking that time. Yes, that's good. Thank you.

**[00:28:27]** Okay. Light is very important for cameras.

**[00:28:39]** Worried that one isn't going to happen?

**[00:28:48]** Oh, I guess I can just get closer. Oh, ok. Yeah, I was confused because they're in a different order on that screen. Ok, go ahead.

**[00:29:00]** Cool. So now I am basically just showing the board to all of the cameras. And the most important thing here is that each of the cameras has friends that there are sufficient frames where each camera can see the board along with one of its compatriots.

**[00:29:27]** Shared views, probably good.

---

### Chunk 4 [00:29:15 - 00:39:14]

**[00:29:15]** Friends that there are sufficient frames where each camera can see the board along with one of its compatriots.

**[00:29:27]** Shared views. Probably good.

**[00:29:32]** And I wish I could turn the projector on and off, but. But it's slow, so I guess we'll see.

**[00:29:58]** Now I know how to do it. Oh.

**[00:30:04]** See, other professors just show up and give PowerPoints. That's like, I don't know how to do that.

**[00:30:12]** Could you pull up the terminal?

**[00:30:21]** Okay, so it's thinking. And what it's doing here is can you, like, control plus embiggen it?

**[00:30:34]** Does it work? Well, anyways, if you.

**[00:30:42]** So basically this is like, just readouts of, like, what it's doing under the hood. And it's basically just doing a bunch of geometry. And right now, this number here you probably can't read. It says 895. That is the number of frames that were recorded from all of the cameras.

**[00:30:58]** There's two things to worry about. Time and space. Time we handle through synchronization. And there's a bunch of many gallons of my life poured into making sure that this thing records frames from each camera synchronously. Like it within.

**[00:31:20]** It's a 30fps camera, which means that every frame you get a new frame every 33 milliseconds. I use frame interchangeably with image because of the history of cinema, I guess.

**[00:31:34]** So we have 895 synchronized frames from each camera. And that synchronization is sort of how we do the time synchrony. If I compared the frame that happened at t, time equals 12 from this one and compared that to the one that this one got at time equals 13. I can't use those to figure out where the thing I'm measuring is because look at different times. So we do.

**[00:32:04]** This is where we tell when this third one finishes. It will either fail or not fail. And we'll find out together.

**[00:32:15]** Yeah. So you have synchronization between. You get synchronized measurements for. From three locations. Three locations which are not moving.

**[00:32:23]** That's important. This guy would not be a good tool camera because it moves. So I could do the calibration thing, but then it would move around, and then I can't get good measurements.

**[00:32:39]** We're good. Anyone here done any optimization stuff? Anyone touched that in your life? People heard the term optimization. Like, weird math.

**[00:32:50]** This is doing optimization right now to figure out. Basically use the measurements that we got to figure out where each camera was in space. And it says it was successful. Could you find that and pop it open? Yeah, yeah.

**[00:33:07]** Just.

**[00:33:12]** I think just Double click that.

**[00:33:15]** Yeah. Okay, so this is where the cameras presumably are. Camera 0, 1 and 2, because we start counting from 0 because someone decided that was a good idea.

**[00:33:28]** Matrix size is that. That's the pixels. So it's a low resolution image, but that's okay. Rotation. So this is camera zero.

**[00:33:38]** So the translation. Translation is like moving. So basically it's position translation from the origin. 0, 0, 0. Because it's camera zero.

**[00:33:49]** Great. This one's camera one. It's negative 2719. Negative 516. These are millimeters, so roughly 2.7 meters away.

**[00:34:03]** If it said 20,000, I'd be like, oh, shit, something messed up. But I don't know if this is right. But gut check. Scale is that it's close to enough. So we like that.

**[00:34:13]** And then this one down here, 1160. So it looks like the order is 01, 2. Is that right? Doesn't really matter. Is that right?

**[00:34:24]** Oh, also there's these other guys which matter a lot. And then these rotation variables, those are Euler angles. When you see it written down, it's spelled E U, L E R. And you probably think Uler Euler. And then you hear people say Euler. Those are the same guy.

**[00:34:41]** So FYI, X, Y, Z rotation. So this is the X axis. This is the Y axis. This is the Z axis. Rotation around X. Rotation around Y. Rotation around Z.

**[00:34:55]** These are radians. I trust that that's where those cameras live. Great. So we have an estimate of where the cameras are.

**[00:35:06]** Now we can try to measure more interesting behavior.

**[00:35:12]** Yeah, I guess. Turn it off.

**[00:35:19]** How did I do it?

**[00:35:24]** Oh, no. My hubris.

**[00:35:32]** Should I bring it back?

**[00:35:38]** The back is the answer.

**[00:35:47]** We'll see. Okay, so I'm Huck finning my pants so that more of my body will be visible because it's too cold to wear shorts. And remember, we're going to be pretending like I'm one of these. And so, like, it's better if the joints are visible because these pants are kind of open. So if I were to throw it down here, it's harder to tell what my knee is doing.

**[00:36:22]** Right. It's harder for you as a human to do it. So it definitely be harder for a rectangle of silicone to do it. Silicon. Whatever.

**[00:36:37]** Okay, so let's just do.

**[00:36:58]** Let's do four separate recordings. So we'll call the first one rom and then the second one Balance Control. Third one balance kettlebell, and then jumping. So, yeah, nice at the start. Yes.

**[00:37:28]** And I need. Yeah. A pose, a pose, a pose, A pose. It helps me because.

**[00:37:43]** Okay, so, yeah, so I'm going to. We're going to take four recordings and the first one's kind of like, again, kind of calibration Y. I'm going to be doing kind of like boring stuff, like simple control standing stuff, just to sort of make sure things look right in later stuff. Because in these later ones are going to be moving more and doing more interesting stuff. So start with something simple. So we're going to start with an A pose, which is T pose.

**[00:38:10]** We've heard of that. It was like a joke for a while. This happens because under the hood and all your favorite animation things, it's these guys. And if you set all the joint angles to zero, it's that. So whenever the code fucks up under the hood and the data becomes unbound to the model T pose.

**[00:38:31]** So that's why that happens.

**[00:38:36]** T pose. A pose. Just get it. Because we tend to do an A pose in this world because it takes up less space and.

**[00:38:48]** Oh, right. Yeah.

**[00:38:52]** I'm gonna put this here.

**[00:38:58]** Just like, give me a sense of where to stand.

**[00:39:04]** Yeah, let's move me first and then. Cool. Oh, there's a fucking plug the whole time.

---

### Chunk 5 [00:39:00 - 00:48:59]

**[00:39:00]** Stand.

**[00:39:04]** Yeah, let's move. Me first and then. Cool. Oh, there's a plug the whole time.

**[00:39:20]** Well, you should have stopped me. What's that? No, no, I never said that. That's called gaslighting. It's very effective.

**[00:39:35]** It's good to, like, practice recognizing that because it just shows up. Okay, what are we doing? I'm in class. Who are you people? Jesus Christ.

**[00:39:46]** The top one. Okay.

**[00:39:53]** Helpful. See, it's really helpful to have, like, an externalized nervous system to handle certain tasks.

**[00:40:02]** A pose, standing, range of motion. I'll just count it off. Okay. Can you swing like you're going to do with range of motion? Oh, well.

**[00:40:17]** So this one. Oh, I see. Yeah. Right backwards. You guys can't see that, unfortunately, but it looks like this.

**[00:40:27]** But three of them. Okay.

**[00:40:31]** Yes. Three, two, one. Okay. 1 1,000, 2 1,000, 3 1,000, 4 1,000, 5 1,000. And I guess I'm still standing at.

**[00:40:43]** I think. Yeah, standing is fine. Range of motion. So this is the top one. Then we got these ones and we got those ones.

**[00:40:53]** They only go one way. Got these wrists. Got hands, which is cool. Got a waist, which is neat. We got one leg that goes like this.

**[00:41:05]** We got another leg that goes like that.

**[00:41:10]** If I missed anything, I'll definitely get it.

**[00:41:19]** Good.

**[00:41:27]** We should. I wish we had told it not to auto process because then we could keep recording. Shut it down.

**[00:41:36]** Let it. Let it finish synchronizing first.

**[00:41:41]** Yeah. Let it finish synchronizing, then loop it through. Yeah. So from that we're going to be able to measure. The first thing is going to be the.

**[00:41:51]** Well, this happens every recording, but the first one, kind of a simpler one, we will get the length of the rigid bodies. So I tried to go through the catalog of wobbly bits and move my rigid bodies through roughly their full range of motion.

**[00:42:15]** And if we wanted to use that later, I actually don't have any pipelines that really use that data, but useful to look at. And now we're restarting it to get another one because we forgot to click the button that says don't auto process.

**[00:42:35]** Just add. Yeah.

**[00:42:40]** I was so close to using like the new. Trying to use the new one for this class, but it seemed like a bad idea.

**[00:42:52]** Freemocap, nv, Dash env. Yeah.

**[00:42:58]** Yes. So the next parts we're gonna look are gonna be about posture and balance and standing and balance and whatnot. So it's weird as hell that we're bipeds. First thing. It's wild move to just use two little feet.

**[00:43:17]** Pretty much it's us. Birds, angry bears and kangaroos at a full hop are the only guys that really stand on two feet.

**[00:43:30]** There's a long, weird story about how we got here. Long story short, we used to be basically squirrels, lived in the trees. So we were doing this on the branches. And then someday we were like, let's stand up and go over there. And the rest is history.

**[00:43:45]** It got way complicated after that, but bold move.

**[00:43:53]** So this is one of those things where, like, we look at animals, do stuff, and we're like, oh, my God, I can't believe that fish is good at swimming. But then we don't notice that we're basically, like, gracefully gliding and teeter tottering all over the world. And the way that we control that is sort of highly complex from both a sort of physical perspective and also from a balanced perspective or like a neural perspective. Great. What's this one called?

**[00:44:24]** Let's call this balance control.

**[00:44:32]** And so why are we on time? 12:55. Someday I won't talk the entire time. I promise.

**[00:44:49]** Yeah, so I'll just say it out loud. There's a concept called the base of support. It's exactly what you think it is. There's also a concept called the center of mass. It's roughly what you think it is.

**[00:45:00]** The. If the base of support is. If the center of mass is above the base of support, we're good. If it goes outside, we fall over. So static equilibrium.

**[00:45:12]** Doing great. Oh, my God. I'm falling. It's okay. I have two feet.

**[00:45:15]** I do this all the time. This is called walking. I'm going from point A to point B. Everybody following is pretty high, complex stuff. Great.

**[00:45:26]** So one of the things my body's really good at is that. And I'm very good at just standing and keeping upright. And I tend not to fall over, especially if I'm not doing anything Interesting. I can make it harder and do this. My basal support just got way smaller.

**[00:45:41]** It's a little harder. I feel my body working at it. But again, I've been here before. I can do this. Not all day, but I can do it for a while.

**[00:45:50]** Great. That's good. Yeah. So I'll start in a pose. Also, it doesn't record sound, so I can just talk while I'm doing it.

**[00:46:00]** Yeah. Start in the A pose. Thank you. And keep an eye on the time. Let me know if it goes over a minute.

**[00:46:08]** Just say minute.

**[00:46:12]** Three, two, one. All right. And now we're recording. Look at me. I'm doing it.

**[00:46:19]** I'm standing here, but I don't just have to stand here. I can also lean. I can lean pretty far forward. I can lean all the way to the right. I can lean all the way to the left.

**[00:46:29]** And I know when to stop. My body just kind of like stops. And there's a certain sensation that I have of I can't go any farther because my center of mass, that limits my base of support. My arms are a part of that. If I go forward, I can't.

**[00:46:46]** I have to lean my butt back, the whole thing. Great. Now I'm doing one foot. This is harder, but I'm doing it. Look at me go.

**[00:46:55]** And I can jump. Wow. I did all that. How are we doing on time? Look at me go.

**[00:47:03]** Great.

**[00:47:09]** Ta da. Okay, that's probably good.

**[00:47:15]** It looks much more impressive when it's in the. When it's data.

**[00:47:22]** Did you turn the thing off? Nice. Okay. I weigh, roughly speaking, one body mass, give or take. And when I'm controlling my body, sort of throwing arrows into the ground in order to, like, push the meat in the desired direction, I put the arrow in the opposite way that I want to go.

**[00:47:50]** I'm putting those forces into the ground appropriately for the mass. Now, if you wanted to compare me to something, saying that I weigh one body mass is not particularly helpful. So if you wanted to compare me to some external reference, I weigh roughly 95 liters of water, which is the same thing as 95 kg, because metric is cool like that.

**[00:48:18]** This. Did Michael bring this over? Look at you. So Aaron did a farmer's carry of this object across campus.

**[00:48:31]** This weighs 45 pounds. So you can convert that. Was that like 20ish kilograms, which is like a fifth of my body weight. But look at me standing. I have not even fallen over.

**[00:48:42]** How in God's name am I able to do that? With difficulty, Impossible injury. But yeah. So we do kind of a similar thing. Probably less jumping if I die on camera.

---

### Chunk 6 [00:48:45 - 00:58:45]

**[00:48:45]** Able to do that with difficulty, impossible injury. But yeah. So we're gonna do kind of a similar thing. Probably less jumping if I die on camera. Analyze the data, balance kettlebell, KB or kettlebell.

**[00:49:11]** Okay, so I'm going to start in the A pose, then I'm going to pick up the. Who's it?

**[00:49:18]** 1, 1000, 2, 1000, 3, 1000. And now here I am standing. What do you think this data looks like relative to the other data? So I'm going all the way over here to this side again and I'm going to go all the way over there to that side. I'm going to go all the way forward.

**[00:49:37]** I don't know what this is gonna track. The system doesn't track kettlebells. Just to be clear. It only tracks human bodies or human body shaped objects. God.

**[00:49:48]** Jesus. Fuck.

**[00:49:54]** Okay, that's. Jesus. Okay, there we go. So before, if we're measuring center of mass relative to base of support and we do that again here, what's it going to look like? What's that answer going to look like?

**[00:50:11]** Especially considering that we're not measuring the kettlebell, we're just measuring the body.

**[00:50:18]** Fuck me. Jesus. Okay, good things. I do.

**[00:50:34]** Ooh. What's that data going to look like?

**[00:50:40]** So we can ask the question qualitatively. What's it going to look like? Like it's going to be this shifted there. Wow. We can ask the question quantitatively, which has numbers in it.

**[00:50:54]** You start with a qualitative estimate and then you measure the quantitative thing. And if they don't line up, something went wrong either in your measurement or in your intuition or both.

**[00:51:08]** Okay, so I weigh roughly one body mass. Multiply that by one G. That's one body weight. So I'm now pushing down on the ground with one body weight of force. The arrow that's pointing into the earth is the same that it's.

**[00:51:46]** So I'm M. That's a kilogram. G is meters per second squared. So if you accelerate, you move. So yeah, meter, if you move it over time and it goes. It was here and then one second later it's there.

**[00:52:06]** That's one meter per second. If it. This is one meter per second and then one second later it goes two meters, then it's accelerating at one meter per second per second. So one meter per second. Great.

**[00:52:25]** One meter per second per second. Great. You can combine these apparently and get 1 meter per second squared. Wow. And then if we multiply a kilogram by a meter per second squared, you get a Newton, which is the name for that.

**[00:52:42]** Great. Easy. Don't worry about it. The machine knows how to do that, so you don't have to. The important thing is that I weigh one and my weight is also one.

**[00:52:52]** Just divide this all by numbers. I don't actually care how much water weighs.

**[00:52:59]** So if I'm standing here, I'm putting force into the ground. That's the same as how much I weigh. If I'm doing this posture, there's some weird stuff going on in my joints. We don't have to worry about that. Now.

**[00:53:12]** I can put more force into the ground than I weigh. And if I do, what will happen? Will I go into the Earth? Will I go to the side? Where will I go?

**[00:53:32]** Amazing. Spectacular. Yeah, that's called jumping. And basically what that means is, for a period of time, I put more force into the ground than I weigh. So I was periodically freed from the tyranny of Earth.

**[00:53:48]** But then it comes back and grabs me. And if you measured it, it would be what this was, but with better handwriting.

**[00:54:07]** I'm going to a pose. I'll do a big jump. I'll do 10 small jumps. I'll try to do another big jump, and then I'll try to jump on one foot. And then if I'm not dead, we can call it there.

**[00:54:23]** Okay. Okay. God damn it. Okay.

**[00:54:34]** Okay. 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000, 3, 1,000. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Oh, that's too many. Okay.

**[00:54:55]** God damn it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, Four, five, six, seven, Eight, nine, ten.

**[00:55:17]** One of the rules of being a professor is if you want undergrads think you're cool, just say fuck in front of them. Just, like, one time.

**[00:55:24]** But I say it a lot, so you'll be all right. Okay.

**[00:55:33]** I guess let that one ride. Or just.

**[00:55:40]** Yeah.

**[00:55:58]** Okay.

**[00:56:15]** Could you pull up the terminal again?

**[00:56:24]** Is that good? Is it.

**[00:56:32]** Is it running? Or do you have to tell it to. I have to tell it to. Okay. Yeah.

**[00:56:37]** So those are the videos. There are three of them.

**[00:56:47]** And now it will do a lot of math.

**[00:56:57]** And as these things scroll by, some of this. Yeah, this is the guy doing the math. 7%. And this is all stacked up. So this is all three processing at once.

**[00:57:10]** The amount of human labor boiled into this little pink line is tremendous. There's, like, human labor from me, from. From Aaron, from other people, from people using the software around the world. But that's nothing compared to all the other stuff, because I didn't invent computers. I didn't write the amount of code that goes into this.

**[00:57:39]** Where code is just math written in English is mostly spent in importing other people's packages. Like you import Numpy and then you get to do linear algebra, you install Python and then you get to write stuff that looks like this. And as you do so code is just text files that live on your computer and they get converted into binary and that crunches numbers and blah, blah, blah.

**[00:58:11]** It winds up comprising like gigabytes of text files. Go into writing the numbers that are being crunched on this thing. And that is work that's being. That was done by people over the past, let's say 40 to 50 years, arguably back to, I mean, you got Claude Shannon making, basically writing down information theory. And then you got what's his name, Blatchley park guy Turing, Alan Turing back in the 50s.

**[00:58:44]** And you got.

---

### Chunk 7 [00:58:30 - 01:08:30]

**[00:58:30]** Arguably back to, I mean, you got Claude Shannon making, basically writing down information theory, and then you got what's his name, Blotchley park guy, Turing, Alan Turing back in the 50s. And you got like Ada Lovelace going back to Al Khwarizmi, who was a Iraqi guy who invented the algorithm, back to Babylonians crunching numbers.

**[00:59:02]** And it all kind of goes together. And luckily for us, unlike the motherfuckers that made the motion capture system, everybody that wrote the code that went into this pink line shared it, they allowed other people to use it, and they allowed their effort to make the world a generally better place where any human can do more things than they could have done before that person did that work. The other alternative, the standard practice and most of the software that you use in your life is to do a bunch of work based off an understanding and a knowledge and a capacity that you have greater than the people around you. And once you've made something useful, exploit the disparity that you have created to extract resources from the people around you. I don't like that option as a person anyways.

**[00:59:58]** So what that was doing, it was crunch. The pink line is really where most of the work was happening. The white line is doing the simpler triangulation stuff. The pink line is where we are trying to extract skeletons from rectangles of light. And this is where we are triangulating, comparing the two dimensional estimates.

**[01:00:18]** Because cameras get a 2D view. I don't have marker camera, camera, person triangulation. See how that works? Wow. If you decided to point a laser at me and then you also pointed a laser at me, and then you told each other where you were sitting and what angle you were pointing the laser.

**[01:01:00]** And as long as you both confirmed that it was like overlapping, here, you could do the math to figure out what the distance is, even though you have no idea how far your laser is actually going. Conceptually makes sense, qualitative understanding. I promise you the part where you know the math is not relevant to that baseline understanding.

**[01:01:31]** Great. So we did the 2D stuff. We looked at the rectangle of pixels and we did. This is the part where it draws a skeleton on top. I guess you probably haven't seen much of that data yet, so I'll show it to you in a second.

**[01:01:50]** Remember what all this stuff is?

**[01:01:59]** Oh, you might need to run it again. Oh, never mind, I lied. So that part is where it gets shoved into Blender. Did you all download Blender kind of thing? So Blender is a free open source animation software.

**[01:02:14]** Again, made for free and given to the world as a gift. Freely given. And it's made for animators and artists and people like that who are artists who specifically traipse around in the world of creating extremely precise 3D renderings of hypothetical worlds.

**[01:02:39]** Yeah. Yeah. So basically. Yeah. Cool.

**[01:02:46]** So we take.

**[01:02:49]** There we go. Here, I'll drive. Thank you. Yeah.

**[01:02:58]** Behold.

**[01:03:05]** Gee, camera.

**[01:03:12]** Check it out. It's the world you live in. Sort of.

**[01:03:18]** Oh, I'm so. At least having a mouse.

**[01:03:26]** Yeah. Oh, oh, there we go.

**[01:03:44]** So that's Skelly and Whee.

**[01:03:57]** Oh, I guess I kept going. I have to figure out how to rotate alt. There we go.

**[01:04:05]** So not as high because I'm tired.

**[01:04:16]** So this thing right here. Calm down. That is my center of mass, such as it is.

**[01:04:30]** And if I do that, I say in range. I say a round frame. I say plus or minus 30. 30. Nope, nope.

**[01:04:36]** 30. 30. Calculate. Yes. Haha.

**[01:04:43]** Oh. And then I say, don't show the frame numbers. Make it red. No, don't show the frame numbers.

**[01:04:55]** Look at it go.

**[01:04:59]** So if you look.

**[01:05:12]** So here I am standing, man standing.

**[01:05:19]** Look at this rectangle of pixels. And then look at this unbelievable gobsmacking magic of being able to draw a dot on my left shoulder. And. And it's kind of correct. This is the part that's kind of AI.

**[01:05:34]** It's not. This is machine learning, uses convolutional neural networks. It's roughly the same math as what's the bot when you're talking to it, but it's for pictures somehow. Don't worry about it. This is the magical step.

**[01:05:45]** This is the part that, like, shouldn't be possible. It's also the part that's the hardest to, like, understand from the outside. The trigonometry and linear algebra stuff. I can do that all day. I can know that it's right when I do it.

**[01:06:00]** This one I can't. Luckily, this weird magic step draws a skeleton on top of a picture of a person. And I happen to have roughly 12 billion years of evolution that lets me be real good at telling you where the picture of the person is in the image. So I can look at it and say, yeah, that's right. That's working pretty good.

**[01:06:20]** So that's very important that the only magical step in this pipeline is. Is the part that you can confirm with your eyeballs qualitatively. And if you want to quantitatively understand if it's actually measured or anything good, you have to get like a PhD. That's like literally what he's doing is, like, validating it beyond the gut check is like, that's pretty good. But if you want real numbers, it's like, a lot of work.

**[01:06:44]** And then how are we doing on time?

**[01:06:51]** We're doing okay. So now that's a silly skeleton.

**[01:06:59]** Okay, do that, do that. Say graph editor. Then we click on this guy again. Hey, hey. And then we say, normalize.

**[01:07:09]** And then we say, I will data. Look at me go.

**[01:07:24]** This tool, this. So Blender is not a scientific tool. It was not made to be a scientific tool. I am abusing it into being a scientific tool.

**[01:07:34]** And it's. It is grateful for the experience.

**[01:07:40]** Select grab. Grab.

**[01:07:47]** So this is a complicated thing. It's got ribs, it's got a pelvis. It's got this skull. All these parts have weird shapes. I didn't actually measure these things.

**[01:08:04]** I didn't measure where the hips were. I didn't measure much of anything.

**[01:08:09]** I only measured these little dottos here. And even that's pretty abstract. And we're making inferences about what the more complicated shapes we're doing by tracking those dots, because we are going to pretend that things like pelvis, that.

---

### Chunk 8 [01:08:15 - 01:16:06]

**[01:08:15]** And we're making inferences about what the more complicated shapes we're doing by tracking those dots. Because we are going to pretend that things like pelvises and the associated meat are rigid bodies. And because they are rigid bodies, you only need to track a couple of points on them to know what the other ones are doing. Wobbly bodies don't have that property. Rigid bodies do.

**[01:08:44]** So we like rigid bodies. This skeleton is kind of aesthetic. We can also look at, huh, These little stickos, these sticks are the actual rigid bodies that we are inferring as the thing that connects the actual dots, where the dots are the 3D positions that are triangulated from the things in the image. So we measured some rectangles of light. We inferred some stick figures in 2D.

**[01:09:24]** We reconstructed some dottos in 3D. We put sticks on them, we put a skeleton on them. And now it's doing all this weird stuff. But I gotta be honest, that's still pretty complicated. It's got things like joints.

**[01:09:39]** Those joints have angles. I don't want to have to deal with any of that. So what we're going to do is going to take all of these things, shift all you guys. Not you, hide. You who Z control.

**[01:10:08]** Anyways, let's see. Get you hide.

**[01:10:17]** Don't do that.

**[01:10:25]** Nah. Who cares? Anyways? Yeah, this. Because this is the trajectory of the whole body.

**[01:10:31]** I don't want to analyze that. I. So luckily we can boil this whole guy down into just this. And we can look at things like. So I want to know what my.

**[01:10:45]** Like, we talked about, like, putting those arrows into the ground in order to like, launch ourselves off the floor, if we're into that type of thing. How hard did I push off of the ground? Like, how much force did I put into the ground when I did that jump? I forgot the force plate. And unfortunately, that moment is gone forever.

**[01:11:05]** Right? Lost into the past. All we have is the measurements that we had. And those measurements are kind of these impoverished webcam y who's it very abstract.

**[01:11:15]** And I want to know how hard I pushed, right? I care about that for some reason. Luckily, physics is pretty rigid. And I can make a lot of estimates about what was going on at some approximation by just looking at this weird shape. Because one of the interesting things about complicated bodies is no matter how complicated you are, if I put you in a catapult, I can predict your location very directly.

**[01:11:53]** Doesn't matter how complicated it is. It follows the same rules in the air. So even though I can't tell you what each knee was doing from this type of measurement. I can't tell you what my hips and stuff are doing. I can tell you in a broad stroke how many newtons my body is going to have to absorb when it gets from this point down to that point.

**[01:12:21]** Whee. Boo. And then you can also show. I don't know if this is real, real data.

**[01:12:35]** If you really squint. And believe me, there's a little bit of a. Because it's a lot of meat I got to throw around. And I'll bet if you measured this, it would be somehow worse than this. What's worse?

**[01:12:51]** Hard to know.

**[01:12:55]** We also know wheel. So now I'm doing this on my. The ground. I now. So before I don't know which knee is doing what.

**[01:13:06]** Now I do because I've constrained the behavior to be easier to measure. I can also see I'm kind of like bouncing around. Like, I'm not staying in one place. There's some control loop that's happening. I'm guiding something.

**[01:13:19]** There's something that's being steered. Whatever that thing is, is probably. It feels like it should be related to whoever it was that lets me do this. Right. Seems like it should.

**[01:13:30]** Maybe, maybe not. This one's in my arm. That one's in my leg. This one's static. That one's moving.

**[01:13:40]** Hard to know.

**[01:13:46]** I couldn't really. I could get this data in the big fancy lab, but it would honestly be difficult. It's not made for this type of stuff. You have to put the full body on. I couldn't have gotten that much data while standing in front of a classroom, both because there's no cameras on the walls here, and also just because it takes longer than that.

**[01:14:05]** And I certainly couldn't have shown you how to do it, because even if I could, a requisite aspect of that is start with a quarter million dollars that you're going to spend to record people, Whereas now it's been 20 bucks on some webcams. And figure out how to run stuff from command line. You have to type and then push enter.

**[01:14:28]** And that's the class. So thank you for watching. And between now and next week, somebody, it's unclear who, is going to take this data and kind of package it up and put it somewhere online that you can watch it and use it. You might not. Then next week we'll get into actually how to open the things, look at the data, and there's going to be an assignment for this week which is basically like talk to the bot about what the hell that was all about, because every one of you saw something different when I did all that stuff.

**[01:15:06]** And I am very curious about what comes out when you talk about it. To the rectangle. That is so friendly and polite. Okay, thank you.

**[01:15:24]** Now we have 10 minutes to break down before someone gets mad at us.

**[01:15:30]** I sent you an email that I saw it. Probably not. Okay. Is that, like, a good method? No, I just get so much email.

**[01:15:40]** So you can absolutely send me email, but if I'll probably miss it, shoot me a message on discord is the easiest way. I didn't know if discord is, like, too, like, informal. It a little bit is, but it's like, for the first message, I was like, I'm going to be safe. That's wise. Wise.

**[01:15:53]** What was the question? And also, if I. If it's important, just send it again. Okay. I was just wondering about the attendance policy.

**[01:16:00]** If I had to miss a class for, like, Thanksgiving break. Is there, like, a zoom option? No. You're out. Sorry.
