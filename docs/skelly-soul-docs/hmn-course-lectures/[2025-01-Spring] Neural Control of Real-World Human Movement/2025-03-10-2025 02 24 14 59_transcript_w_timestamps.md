### Chunk 1 [00:00:00 - 00:09:59]

**[00:00:00]** Okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi.

**[00:00:06]** All right, let's do. Let's do today. So I guess spring break is next week, so that's nice. I am once again standing here before you as a liar and a generally untrustworthy person. Because I said I was going to have the stuff for this done by today.

**[00:00:29]** I don't hit some. It's like I once again did the thing of making an assignment that requires technical capacity that did not exist at the time that I made the assignment. So I'll give you a quick update on that. But I should have something.

**[00:00:48]** I'll try to have something done by Wednesday and then just push all the deadlines out so that kind of like things will kind of be spread out over the end of the, you know, the next of the couple weeks. And yeah, you should all be set up for it. So the content of the lecture today is going to be about vision and eyeballs and sort of how that stuff generally works. We've covered it a little bit in the kind of like the overview stuff at the beginning of the semester, but now we're going to go a little more in depth of that stuff. So some things that I sort of probably hit pretty fast in passing.

**[00:01:22]** I'm going to hit still pretty fast in passing, but at a slightly slower rate.

**[00:01:30]** But yeah. And then so next Wednesday, so tomorrow, class. Wednesday, class, I will bring in an eye tracker and we'll do kind of an eye tracking demo similar to the one I did with the motion capture, but less involved because it's. All the cameras in that process are attached to my head, so it's a little bit easier to set up. And then, yeah, then we'll have spring break and we'll kind of go over that and blah, blah, blah for the rest of the class.

**[00:02:01]** Quick, let's see how much time I want to do this.

**[00:02:11]** I'll go. I think I'll do it. I'll just give a quick update on kind of the, you know, my assignment for the course of making sense of all your guys wacky nonsense.

**[00:02:26]** So very quickly, the technical side of the thing I need to do, so the main technical challenge here is that I want to do these exam chats, which I talked about last week, but a lot of y' all weren't here, so I'll say it again, is basically to sort of create some chat spaces in the server where the bot has been kind of the prompt of the bot has been doped with the content of the lectures that I've been giving and recording and putting online and Then have kind of like two forms of that chat set up, one of which is sort of designed to work with you kind of grinding through whatever your chosen topic was and trying to attach the concepts that we've been talking about in terms of the sort of philosophy of science, aspects of empirical measurement and sort of like what's actually being recorded from the environment and stuff like that, and sort of connecting those thoughts to the topic that you have chosen. And then the other version of that will be specifically tuned to helping you come up with your poster proposal number two, which is basically just kind of an outline, sort of schematized form of your paper that says, this is my paper, this is the methods, you know, this is the intro, methods, results, discussion, sort of in, you know, two sentences or less about the paper that I've chosen. And then that will be kind of the content of the poster that you're actually sort of submitting, which. So, yeah, and then the, the poster draft wants to be due the week after spring break. And I'll do.

**[00:04:34]** Trying to figure out where probably in here right now. It doesn't make sense. I don't know. I'll have some time in class to kind of like, you know, go over what you have and sort of answer questions and things like that. The draft is not the final of the.

**[00:04:48]** Not the final form of it. It's sort of. The intention is that this is. It is a completed poster which if you were forced to, you could print and sort of talk about. But we're intentionally going to give some space to that so that you can have time to kind of go over it with people around you and sort of like have a couple opportunities to kind of try to work through it with your classmates and kind of be like, oh wait, I actually wish this was this way, that way and the other so that by the time we actually submit the thing to be uploaded and printed on March 25th, you're about ready for it.

**[00:05:22]** Because once it's printed, it just exists and so you can't. It's good to have some opportunities to edit there.

**[00:05:31]** So yeah, so the technical side of that is the part of condensing down the lectures into a form that can fit into the prompt of an AI bot, which just by way of sort of like passive education, I'll just point out where that's happening in the course repository. So because it's kind of like. So at this point, I think there's six ish recorded lectures, each of which is like somewhere between an hour to an hour and a Half long. So that's a lot of just words. It's a lot of human saying words.

**[00:06:08]** And it's relatively easy at this point in history and my own personal development to pull the content, like the pull the words that were spoken in a video on YouTube into a text based format. But there's a couple challenges there because for the one thing, it's just so many words. Like the number of words that you say when speaking for an hour and a half is much, much higher than the actual meaningful content that you're expressing. And also when you speak out loud, you are not, generally speaking, grammatically. Like, if you wrote down the words that I'm speaking, which I know because I've been looking at that, it sounds like a person having a stroke.

**[00:06:51]** Like, it's not like we feel like we're speaking in grammatical form sentences, but we're not like. And so I've been writing some sort of AI code, sort of sloppy by my own personal standards, but does the job that goes through and firsts does this kind of thing. So takes the content, chunks it out into 10 minute sections and then just sends it to an AI that says clean this up and remove all the ums and ahs and make it into grammatical sentences and stuff, stuff like that. This code is effectively the same thing as copy pasting things into the discord bot. It just happens in an automated way.

**[00:07:37]** So if I give an hour long lecture that's chunked into 10 minute chunks, that's six total chunks. And so this just runs in a loop and does that. So it takes the lectures, cleans them up and then this is the part that's not quite. Actually the first part is it pulls it from YouTube. Then it.

**[00:07:53]** This is the part where I'm going to take those chunks and then sort of boil them down into kind of like outline formats at which point they will have been condensed down to the point that they can be kind of included in a bot chat and sort of, sort of the idea is that having a conversation with the bot that has been prompted by all this stuff will be kind of like a crappy simulation of what it would be like if I was sitting down and working through this sort of one on one, which I would love to do, but the realities of numbers sort of make that difficult.

**[00:08:27]** So if you're curious about that, you can look in here in the course repo. This lecture transcripts has got kind of the. I guess what is that cleaned? Is the. Probably, yeah.

**[00:08:40]** Is that right? I don't know. Anyways, but it's a lot of words.

**[00:08:49]** These are all the words I've said to you.

**[00:08:54]** Yeah, so. So that's ongoing. And then the other aspect of that of kind of the exam ish chats is that I'll be asking you to sort of pull in the the profiles that have been kind of getting extracted about you. So we've talked about this before but like the lecture, the chats that you've been having with the bot have been part of this process is that I periodically scrape through the server, pull those out and then try to again pull out all the chats that you've had, smush them together and shove them into the bot and say what is this person interested in? What is their sort of focus?

**[00:09:32]** What should they be? What are some things they might want to look at and think about and da da da.

**[00:09:38]** So that has also been ongoing. The latest of that, which I think this one I'm not going to go into but I again put a zip file of the latest sort of server wide analyses.

---

### Chunk 2 [00:09:45 - 00:19:44]

**[00:09:45]** That which I think this one I'm not going to go into but I again put a zip file of the latest sort of server wide analyses. Come on Discord in the discord channel except this one now has two forms like the zip file has two folders in it, one of which the student profiles for each of you are based off of only your chats from the assignments category. So like the ones who have been specifically prompted to do. And the other one uses all of the chats that you've had total. So every chat that you've participated in is part of it.

**[00:10:38]** Links and resources.

**[00:10:42]** This server scraped checkpoints and this last one here has yeah these two things in it. And again these are exactly the same from the exact same period of time which is everything that happened before about like 8am this morning.

**[00:11:04]** And that's one that says profiles from all channels. Your profile in there is based off every chat that has. Every chat that has your ID in it in any place is included there. So all the class assignments and stuff like that profiles from assignments channel only is all the chats that you've had that are in the assignments. Wait, is it assignments channel or category?

**[00:11:29]** How did I do that? Yeah, and the same as category although I just realized now I may have done that wrong. So they might both have all of you might have everything in it because I did a filter but I think I might have been filtering by channel instead of category. So it may not have worked. So that's an easy fix.

**[00:11:47]** But yeah, I'm not going to dig into that. But if you want to go in there and kind of like compare what's going on there if they're exactly the same and I know that I screwed that up but if they're different part of the examish chat looking things are part of that assignment is going to be pulling in that profile and copy pasting it into the chat so that you are not starting from scratch. So that's going to be one of those things where I'll show you where the high water mark is for that and you can choose how you want to take that file and edit it and delete things you don't think are appropriate, add things you think are appropriate. So I'll probably make both of these formats available to you and you kind of mix and match for yourself and you can decide how you want to prompt the bot to know who you are or if you just don't think it's useful, just don't do it at all. And then you have to explain it Explain yourself again.

**[00:12:48]** Okay. Do, do, do any questions about that make sense? Roughly. Cool.

**[00:13:01]** Okay, great. Well, let's talk about eyeballs, eh?

**[00:13:07]** So eyeballs, they live on your face. The average human has slightly less than 2 and they're generally very useful things.

**[00:13:18]** Great.

**[00:13:21]** This is one of those lectures that I've given this lecture in various formats many, many times and I've never really come up with my personal favorite way of doing it. So this is just kind of like a list of things I want to make sure to hit.

**[00:13:38]** And I think let's start. This is going to want to be a combination of like drawing and stuff on the screen. So yeah. Okay, let's do this.

**[00:14:12]** Okay. So we talked a little bit about vision at the start of the class, but we spent the majority of the time since then talking about motor control. Motor control is sort of moving in the world. So roughly speaking, anything that involves like muscles and sort of the generation of force that moves mass connected to your body is under the category of motor control, motor like motion and the. And you know, good thing to be able to do.

**[00:14:52]** I think my particular area of expertise in studying neuroscience and neural control of movement is in what is generally called perceptual motor control, where the O in the middle means it's sort of perceptual motor. So it's kind of like the connection between the perceptual systems of the body and the motor systems of the body. And those are two things that are often studied to great effect in isolation of each other. But there's in sort of natural behavior especially, they're not really separable in the same kind of way. Like to move your body effectively in a complex and dynamic world requires you to have good perceptual information about that world.

**[00:15:36]** So knowing where things are is a very important component of planning your motions and your movements out effectively.

**[00:15:46]** And vision is a very sort of a classic sense. Not every animal uses vision entirely, but sort of as not every animal has vision as core to their nervous system as we do. But it is a very classic environmental energy to be tapped into. We're going to talk about kind of the evolutionary elements of that at the later point in the semester. I know what I'm trying to do here, but it's basically been around for as long as there have been microbes, sort of the ability to absorb photons from the world and determine sort of dark areas from bright areas is a thing that even single celled organisms do.

**[00:16:35]** Sort of like the rise up to the top of the pool of water in the daytime and ship dropped down at night and that type of thing. So let's take a quick trip through the main sort of pathways of the perceptual system and the. Yeah, so let's start with light itself. So light is covered by like the study of light is generally covered under the field of optics, where optics is kind of the. The part of physics that involves.

**[00:17:13]** With photons and sort of refractions and lenses and stuff like that. Historically, the first sort of the origins of the study of optics as a specific field is generally attributed to Ibn al Haitham, who was 7th century century. Modern Iraq wasn't called Iraq back then, but it was a. He was a scholar in the 7th, 7th to 9th century. I can't remember exactly when, but he was the first person to kind of like start thinking about light specifically and start thinking specifically about light in the context of like, light is the thing that sort of travels in straight lines and it can't be measured in that way.

**[00:18:07]** So pinhole camera. So the story goes that he. Pinhole camera. Pinhole camera. Ibn Al Haitham, yeah.

**[00:18:25]** So the story goes that he was in his tent in the bright, bright, bright sun and noticed that if there was a pinhole prick in the walls of one of these otherwise opaque walls of the tent, you could see an image of the world projected onto the other side of the tent. And this was known as a holiday obscura or a pinhole camera. This was not the first time in history that this sort of optical effect was discovered. I think the original reference of it was in like some sort of ancient Chinese text, but it wasn't at that time. It was sort of presented at that time as like, like, hey, here's this weird thing that happens.

**[00:19:09]** And less of a sort of like looking into like, there's less of an understanding of like why that happened and sort of what's going on. It was sort of like a documentation of a strange optical effect, more than a. The beginning of a deep dive into the mathematics behind optics. So Ibn Al Haytham wrote the book of Optics, which we're going to come back to, wherein he wrote a very long treatise on the study of light and specifically the study of how it interacts with our visual system and including some very.

---

### Chunk 3 [00:19:34 - 00:29:28]

**[00:19:34]** Which we're going to come back to, wherein he wrote like a very long treatise on the study of light and specifically the study of how it interacts with our visual system and including some very prescient. Well, not prescient, just accurate anatomical models of the early visual system. And these thoughts were sort of roughly lost for about, you know, not lost, but they. They did not make it into Europe for about five to 600 years when Descartes came along and translated a bunch of stuff.

**[00:20:11]** And. Yeah, so like the main. So the main idea here was kind of this discovery of light as a thing that exists sort of independently in nature. Obviously people had known that light exists, but it wasn't the kind of thing that had been specifically studied as like an independent natural entity. And the first thing that he was doing, in addition to kind of this nice anatomical work, was just sort of mapping out the basic geometries of how.

**[00:20:40]** What happens if you have this sort of stuff that travels in straight lines and figuring out things like why the. If you. In this pinhole camera situation, why you have the images show up inverted on the projected image. And it's because of all this nice sort of, you know, if the light that's coming from the sun bouncing off the top of the minaret sort of travels down to that point, to the bottom, travels up to that point. That's how you get the kind of inverted image there.

**[00:21:16]** And you'll see this image a lot. Sort of like projection in the eye.

**[00:21:27]** Yeah, this is sort of classic textbook stuff where you're presenting the image as sort of like backward, like upside down on the retina, which is true, but it's sort of. I think it kind of misses some of the point, but that's fine.

**[00:21:46]** So one of the interesting things, one of, like the one. I think one of the reasons why this guy is sort of considered to be like one of the sort of scholars of history was he did a lot of that early work on optics. And like, he kind of hit most of the major points, like pretty, pretty straight off the bat. And particularly in kind of the idea, you know, just sort of project in the projective geometry. Oh, it's this one.

**[00:22:44]** Yeah. So like, this is the kind of epipolar geometry that is used behind that motion capture thing and drawing through the 3D projection and all that kind of stuff. And these are sort of representate. These are like tutorial images from like modern software packages on how to do computer vision. And most of the math for this was kind of worked out way back then.

**[00:23:10]** The main Thing that he didn't have, the main thing that he couldn't quite figure out was refraction in the way that light can. So he understood that light travels in straight lines, but he didn't really understand how lenses worked. And so when you look at some of these images of the eye. Come on, man.

**[00:23:36]** Anyways, a lot of the labels and stuff that happen in here are accurate to this day. Except the one thing that he kind of had wacky going on was in the lens of the eye. He believed that there was a little demon that lived and sort of died, bent the light to make it make sense. Not to say that he believed that there were demons living in your eyes, but it was sort of like a. I think I've already said this in this class, but like, it was kind of like a placeholder of like. I'm not sure what's happening in here.

**[00:24:01]** So I understand that the straight line math doesn't work out because your eyes are too small to do that kind of projection. So it probably has to do with this little thing right here, but I don't really understand how that part works.

**[00:24:16]** And that kind of projective geometry, that sort of refraction stuff. I don't quite know the specific history there, but that was worked out much later. I suppose I should also mention just in the history of things that originally we believed that light, before we really understood light as kind of this environmental thing, vision was sort of conceived of as something that was emitted from your face. Like when you look at stuff. It's called emission theory.

**[00:24:51]** They thought that there was sort of these beams of. Not light, but beams of something that sort of shot out of your face when you looked at stuff. And that was how you received the sensory information from the world. So in the same sense way that you sort of reach out with your limbs to touch things, they thought that there was some kind of invisible substance that was being projected from your eyes. And that stuff touching things was how you perceived the world.

**[00:25:18]** And that was predominantly for a long time. And sort of in like Black Death times, they would do things like cover people's eyes when they were sick. Because they didn't. They knew that, like, you don't want to touch sick people because that will, you know, transmit disease. So they thought they would cover the eyes to sort of make sure that you don't get hit with the eyelids.

**[00:25:44]** Anyways. Yeah, then. Yeah, whatever. So that's kind of. Yeah, the old school optics.

**[00:26:00]** And these days, like if you, if you go to a. If you take an optics course in I Think that'll be mechanical? No. I don't know what kind of engineering that would be. It would be in the engineering department, but I'm not sure.

**[00:26:13]** Probably physics, maybe. Probably physics teaches optics. You'll learn about what's called Snell's Law, which. Snell's Law tells us all the things that can happen when light hits a surface are basically, as light is coming in, it has wavelengths and stuff like that. And when it hits a surface, it will either transmit, go straight through it, be absorbed into the material itself, or reflect.

**[00:26:50]** So transmission, absorption, reflection, those are the three things that light can do when it hits surface. And every surface in the world will have properties related to this. And if it is transmitted, transmission also has a refraction angle. So for some time, sometimes when light passes through a surface, it goes straight through, and for other surfaces, it will refract by a certain amount. And the.

**[00:27:23]** The refraction angle is dependent on the angle that the light hits the surface, as well as the index of refraction, which is just sort of a property that things have.

**[00:27:36]** So substances like glass have a very low index of refraction. So when you look straight through it, not much happens other surf. So if you have something like a lens, then you have refractive aspects that sort of bend the light to the point where it focuses. So if you hit. If it's coming straight on, it goes straight through.

**[00:28:00]** If it's coming in from an angle, it's refracted in like that. And so that's basically how a lens can focus light in on things. And that's how cameras work. That's how glasses work, all that kind of stuff. So this is sort of the Snell's law, optics of what's happening when the light from the world first hits your eye.

**[00:28:32]** Actually, let's do this.

**[00:28:48]** Sure.

**[00:29:00]** Yeah. Nice.

**[00:29:03]** So this is an eyeball, or it's a picture of an eyeball, and we can use this to kind of stuff out.

**[00:29:21]** So this is very much not to scale, but does the job.

---

### Chunk 4 [00:29:21 - 00:39:12]

**[00:29:21]** So this is very much not to scale, but does the job.

**[00:29:36]** So this is a side view of your eyeball. And this thick part here, which. This looks very thick to me. I don't know if there's. I don't know how accurate that is, but it could be.

**[00:29:51]** So this thick part out here is called the cornea. The cornea is a clear surface on the outside of your eye. When you're looking at somebody's eyes, you are looking at their corneas because that's the outermost surface.

**[00:30:06]** And it is, you know, again, I don't know if it's proportionally this thick, but it is thick and it does have refractive properties. And when light is coming in from the world, the first thing that it hits is the cornea. And so the majority of the refraction that happens on your eye that sort of focuses the image on the back of your retina is happening passively by the refractive properties of the cornea that. Yeah, we'll come back to that and look for a better picture of this next part.

**[00:30:53]** Actually, yeah, this is the better picture.

**[00:30:58]** Open.

**[00:31:04]** There you go. So this is the cornea. This proportionality looks closer to me. There is kind of an empty space that is. There's a lot of fluid filled cavities in your eye filled with something called the aqueous humor, which is basically like a clear gelatinous, like fluid liquid type of thing.

**[00:31:31]** And then this part, so the light hits your cornea is refracted in numbers wise. The number I Remember is about 80% of the refraction happens at the cornea level. And then based that refraction happens, the Snell's law thing happens every time light hits a surface that is a different density from the one that it's currently traveling through. So light is not refracting when it's traveling through air, other than when it's sort of bouncing off of sort of water molecules that are suspended in the air, which is why the sky is blue. It's a whole other conversation, but for our purposes, we can assume that the refraction process will happen every time.

**[00:32:13]** There's a boundary between sort of transmissive fluid of one density over here to a different density over here. So that first refractor point happens at the end of the cornea and then it sort of goes through this empty, sort of gets into this opening here. This opening is called your pupil. Perhaps you've heard of it.

**[00:32:47]** So your pupil is one of these nice things that like, it's not. It doesn't have an independent existence. It's basically the name that we give to a void of space. Your pupil is basically the opening in the center of your iris, and the iris is a sphincter muscle, one of your body's finest sphincters, whose job is basically to open and close, to let through different amounts of light relative to the environment that you're in. And it's basically.

**[00:33:23]** There's a lot of interesting reflexes that happen there. The main one that you probably think about is that when you're in a bright. When you're a very bright room, your pupil constricts, which lets through less light. When you're in a darker setting, your pupil expands with us. Do more light, which has a lot of sort of optical properties there.

**[00:33:45]** I think that's related to the aperture. Like, if you're a photography person, it's related to the aperture.

**[00:33:54]** I'm not going to say too much about that. There's other things that happen. Your people. Dilation is affected by other aspects of your physiology. Sort of like things like fear and relaxation and stuff like that.

**[00:34:12]** Like if you get startled or surprised, like an adrenaline burst will constrict your pupils.

**[00:34:18]** And there's a lot of literature studying pupilometry. I think too much literature studying pupillometry. I think it's one of those things. And we'll talk about this in the context of the eye tracker on Wednesday.

**[00:34:33]** It's one of these things where I think that because it's fairly easy to measure the pupil size from an eye tracker, and because you can measure, you can look at that signal independently of the actual context that it's happening in. I think there's just sort of like a sociological effect where people wind up studying, like, the pupillometry and the effects of, like, different emotional states and different stimuli on your pupil size. I think that is studied way, way too much. And there's way, way too much literature on that, mostly because it is relatively easy to study. So the field kind of gets flooded with studies that use that kind of.

**[00:35:09]** That type of an outcome. So it's one of those cases where it's like, I'm not saying we shouldn't study it, but I am saying that if you were to go out and start looking at eye tracking, looking at papers on eye tracking, you would find a lot of papers about pupilometry, and you'll be forgiven for thinking, wow, this is the most important thing to think about here. But resist that feeling. It is not. I think it's.

**[00:35:31]** Yeah, it's fine.

**[00:35:36]** Switch pictures again.

**[00:35:46]** Yeah, works. So, yeah. So the light is coming through.

**[00:35:58]** It's coming in from all directions. You're always being hit by all the light that's sort of bouncing and scattering off of everything in the world. And as that light sort of bounces, it becomes coupled with the things that it's bouncing off of. If you really want to dig into the quantum aspects of it, they do show up here. Like when light bounces off of an object of a given color, that color is absorbed.

**[00:36:26]** So the light that comes off of it. So like that wall back there is green. Then when the light bounces off of it, all of the red wavelengths are absorbed and the stuff that comes off of it is green. Assuming that the light in the environment is generally white, which usually is broad spectrum, then the light that's sort of bouncing into my retina from that part of the room has had all of the red wavelengths sucked out of it. And so the light that comes in is only within the wavelength band that corresponds to like that kind of bluish greenish color of that back wall.

**[00:37:00]** And so that's. That's jumping ahead a bit. But so the light comes through, it refracts some of it, makes it through this pupil opening.

**[00:37:14]** Obvious humor there. Humor is another one of those, like, medieval science terms like talk about your humors and balance, stuff like that. So this is from that sort of era.

**[00:37:29]** And then once the light makes it through your pupil, it hits the second main refractory sort of sort of substance in your eye, which is the lens.

**[00:37:45]** And the lens is a little. It's a lens. It looks like a little lens made out of sort of a clear structural, sort of biological. It's not a goop because the aqueous humor is a goop. The lens is like an object, like a.

**[00:38:05]** More of a. It has its own sort of. But it's like. It's a. It's elastic and clear and sort of oblong in that way.

**[00:38:15]** And it is also actively controlled. Like your brain at some level is controlling how much it should compress this lens because it has these.

**[00:38:31]** This is saying that these are ligaments, which I believe it. There are also muscles attached, and the muscles pull the lens to different shapes. And the different shapes have different refractive indexes. So if it's like this, it refracts more, and then you pull it more elongated and it refracts less. And all of these things have the effect of sort of changing the focal point of the light that's traveling through your eyes relative to the point in space that you're fixating at.

**[00:39:06]** So when you're looking at something and it's in focus on the back of your eyes, where in focus means that you can tell the difference between.

### Chunk 5 [00:39:00 - 00:49:00]

**[00:39:00]** Of the light that's traveling through your eyes relative to the point in space that you're fixating at. So when you're looking at something and it's in focus on the back of your eyes, where in focus means that you can tell the difference between thin lines and stuff like that, that focus implies that that focal point of the light is on your retina.

**[00:39:26]** And so your brain, using some kind of. Using a variety of complex mechanisms, is going to try to stretch and bend this lens structure in order to put that focal point on the back of your retina. How does it know when things are in focus? How does it control it? What are the feedback loops?

**[00:39:44]** These are all great questions that I can guess at, but I don't really know. Sort of like we're sort of at. I might depth of some of this physiology stuff.

**[00:39:55]** It's also the case that this is something that you can control yourself. So if you're.

**[00:40:03]** I think it's like one of those things like wiggling your ears where not everybody can actually do it on their own, but you can at least try. And so if you just like look at something and kind of like fuzz it out, like if you, if you look at an object and just kind of like, you know, flex whatever muscle you have to flex to make that thing go in and out of focus, you are controlling your lens when that's happening. That's the thing that you're flexing is your lens. So you know it. Also, many of you, including me, are probably wearing some sort of corrective lenses, so glasses, contacts, something like that.

**[00:40:41]** Because you might say, and you might even be able to like, find some, some shiesty medical stuff online, suggesting that you need to, that you can, you can exercise the lens muscle and then you don't want, you won't need glasses anymore. That is not actually true because of that sort of 80, 20 division of labor there. Because remember, like 80% of the refraction is happening at the cornea level. And only the sort of. The lens is only doing just a little bit more of that.

**[00:41:12]** So you're not going to be able to actively correct for the whole thing being out of whack, where it's like amblyopia. Sort of like your eye is like too oblong. So if you're farsighted, it's too oblong. If you're nearsighted, it's too. Whatever that is, that shape is.

**[00:41:32]** And so the corrective lenses that you have is basically augmenting the cornea. So if you're in contacts, you're basically putting another layer on top of it. Or if you're wearing glasses, you're putting another lens out here to bend the light a little bit before it even hits the retina so that the resting state of this will have the light generally in focus on the back of your eye. What was that?

**[00:42:04]** Yeah, yeah. So that's for astigmatism, which I don't really understand. I know what you're talking about. And it's like. Because, like, astigmatism is like.

**[00:42:15]** I don't really know what that is. That's a layer of optometry below me.

**[00:42:22]** But yeah, it's like the contact sits on top of it. It's got some kind of a suctiony thing. And so it, like, it pulls the cornea to, like, a slightly different shape to help suck. It's changing the passive refractive properties of the cornea. And it lasts, like, about a day.

**[00:42:40]** So you wear them overnight, and then, like, you wake up. It's wacky. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like hard contact lenses was.

**[00:42:50]** We've got past that as a technology, but that was for a while, like, contact lenses were hard glass things. You have a question.

**[00:43:13]** Slightly bigger. Yes. Larger, like, more stronger.

**[00:43:27]** I know, because they're super extensible.

**[00:43:39]** Okay. Okay. Yeah. So I think astigmatism is so. Because, like, nearsighted and farsighted, it has to do with, like, the overall eyeball shape.

**[00:43:47]** And so I think astigmatism has to do with, like, the cornea itself. Yeah, it's the cornea shape. Yeah, yeah. And so the thing of, like, like the shaping that happens at the eyes or. Yeah, okay.

**[00:44:02]** So everything else is like, we were talking about how there's no way that you can, like, do those muscle exercises for your eyes. Make it, like, you know, a bit easier when people, like, wear contacts and, like, glasses. I've always been like, so you definitely need to take your contacts out because of, like, sanitation and all that stuff. But the, the other thing that you're saying, I think that's just not true. I think that's like, I, I, I, I'm not sure who's saying that.

**[00:44:39]** If it's like, an eye doctor, then maybe. But if it's not an eye doctor, I think that my glasses aren't really working anymore. They're like, oh, because you're warm too much. And now that you're so used to prescription, I don't believe that I am going to pull. I am also Technically a doctor rank and say that.

**[00:44:58]** I don't think that's how that works. I think that we very rapidly adapt to. So first of all, your eyes just change over time and they stabilize. For me, my eyes were. I was getting different prescriptions, like, every time I went into the doctor until I hit like 20, 25 or something like that.

**[00:45:14]** And then I've been at the same prescription since then. We also have very different perspectives on how much focus and precision we expect from our vision. So we all know people. At least I know people. You may be one of these people who has glasses but doesn't wear them, and they're like, yeah, I can tell immediately.

**[00:45:37]** And so what will happen is if you. Is like, it's like. I remember I had a friend who, who was. Who was. Who had that sort of personality capacity, which is fine, not.

**[00:45:51]** And like, it was kind of thing. It's like, I would look. I was looking, I was like, oh, yeah. It's like out there by that sign that says, you know, speed limit is 25. And he was just like, you can see that.

**[00:46:01]** Like, because, you know, we. We all have a distance that we don't expect to be able to see things. Like, if someone was holding up a, you know, eight and a half by 11 paper out there on that sidewalk, I would be able to see them and they're holding up something, but I wouldn't be able to read the paper. That wouldn't freak me out. And because I tend to get my contacts updated pretty frequently, I tend to have pretty.

**[00:46:25]** I can read that street sign out there. Whereas someone else who doesn't would be like, oh, I can't read that. And that doesn't freak me out at all. So it is definitely the case that if you stop wearing your. If you stop wearing contacts, stop wearing glasses, you'll just become more comfortable with, like, not being able to see things and you'll be able to live full and happy life.

**[00:46:43]** But yeah.

**[00:46:48]** Yes.

**[00:46:50]** So it's. So there's multiple types of LASIK surgery and they basically, it's. So in some version of it, they, like, they shave some of it off. And other versions of it, they like pull up a flap and put something underneath it. Like, I think they pull.

**[00:47:13]** They put something in this gap that's clear. I don't really know how it works. I think to some extent it's kind of a measured thing. I know that there's also, like, sometimes I don't know if this happens in a standard eye doctor session, but I know that there's some measurements that involve basically shining a laser through the eye and then imaging it on the back of the retina. And it's kind of one of those things, like if you're shooting a laser point, then you know that it should result in a point, but it's.

**[00:47:46]** So if you look through it and it's diffused and it's like, oh, this is being refracted by this amount. And you kind of handle it that way. There's actually a really interesting history there where that technology that I'm just describing was originally created for spy satellites in, like, the Cold War to, like, be able to focus and try to read stuff from up in low Earth orbit.

**[00:48:09]** And it was later, like, they tapped a bunch of astronomers to be able to, like, look down, but then they classified all the technology. And then eventually the astronomers are like, hey, we made this stuff. Can we use it for our space telescopes? And eventually they did. And then so they.

**[00:48:27]** It's like how we do adaptive optics through the atmosphere where we shine up like a sodium laser at the atmosphere. And then we look at it and we distort the lens until the thing that the point laser becomes a point. And then you say, ok, that's the opposite of the distortion that's happening from the atmosphere. And that's how we can try to image stuff through a roiling atmosphere and get clear images. And then that technology was then flipped around and used to kind of do this, like, through the.

---

### Chunk 6 [00:48:45 - 00:58:43]

**[00:48:45]** And then you say, okay, that's the opposite of the distortion that's happening from the atmosphere. And that's how we can try to image stuff through a roiling atmosphere and get clear images. And then that technology was then flipped around and used to kind of do this like through the retina kind of imaging thing. Yeah, the eye shape when it's.

**[00:49:16]** So that is less so peripheral blindness. So I guess I should say that, you know, there's, I guess there's a variety of sources where that could come from. But I believe that once you start talking about something like peripheral blindness, you're probably no longer talking about something that's happening at the cornea level. There's all sorts of ways and disorders of the eye that happens. Everything, everything in here can go wrong.

**[00:49:43]** And so like glaucoma is what is a hardening of the lens. And that happens often with age. And that's one of those. So there's surgeries. You can, if you're not squeamish, you can look them up online.

**[00:49:56]** There's like a little, there's videos of like eye surgeries where they go in and they break up. Like after the lens has hardened, calcified and age, they can go in there and kind of like break it up and pull it out and then replace it with an artificial lens which is made of some kind of high quality silicone stuff. And apparently it works out pretty well. That's one of those things that were one of the few areas of biology where we can replace something and it's just like, oh yeah, that actually works pretty well. Things like Lasik is a similar thing.

**[00:50:32]** It's like the, the physical properties that matter for this are relatively straightforward. So we can actually control them pretty well. Yeah, I promise you if you look that up, someone's working on it. I think so. Can stem cells help with insert biological issue here?

**[00:50:57]** The answer is probably yes. The challenge with things like stem cells is getting them to do what you want them to do.

**[00:51:05]** So like, and I'm not, I'm not. So where I know that things like stem cells are used a lot is for places in the body that don't generally heal on their own, which is typically non vascular tissue. So like cartilage and meniscus and sort of like the knees and stuff like that because there's no blood flow through those areas, they don't tend to heal in the way that areas that have blood flow do. Because like when you, if you cut your arm, the healing process that happens is not like we Send the ambulances to that area, and it starts to knit up the tissue. The healing happens because, like, stem cells and stuff just in your blood attach to the damaged tissue, and then it sort of heals itself that way.

**[00:51:53]** So things like cartilage, which doesn't have blood flowing through it, doesn't have that sort of healing property. Your eye does have vasculature, so it does have blood running through it, but obviously not like. Not that much in the clear parts. So I wouldn't be shocked if you could find something about, like, repairing eye damage over time from things like stem cells. But as far as I know, there's nothing in, like, clinical practice, but.

**[00:52:23]** But I'll bet they're doing all sorts of stuff to rats because. Yeah, your eye is also one of those spaces that kind of like. It just kind of, like, accrues damage over time. And generally it's like, why I pretty much always, like, wear sunglasses when I'm outside in the daytime, because it's like the blue light, the ultraviolet light is just kind of like, always damaging the biological tissues. And it's very sensitive biological tissue.

**[00:52:53]** And it does heal itself a little bit, but especially once you start getting into, like, the ner. The neural parts of it on the back, it kind of breaks down. It sort of. You know, it doesn't. It doesn't heal itself forever or the.

**[00:53:08]** The rate that it heals itself may. Can't. Can't keep up with the environment. Yeah, you can chalk it up to being a myth. It's like, you know, if you stare at a bright light for too long, it's not great.

**[00:53:33]** But I think that the TV isn't doing that to you. This is one of those areas. I think I mentioned this when we were doing the Mocapi thing, where we have a tremendously. We're very, very, very good at adapting to different light levels. And so it's like, you know, if you look like.

**[00:53:49]** If you look at your phone in the middle of the night, it's like a. You know, it's like a spotlight. But if you look at it when you're outside, even on, like, a not particularly sunny day, you can barely see the screen. The screen is the same bright. You have the settings there, but the screen is the same brightness either time.

**[00:54:03]** It's just your light. The adaptation of your lens, the adaptation of your visual system, which is a complicated thing that's not just your cornea, but, like, all the way through, adapts very, very well. So I think something like sitting too close to a TV it's like we feel like TVs are very, very bright, but they're nothing compared to like being outside on a sunny day. So. Yeah, I don't know.

**[00:54:28]** Yeah. And I don't know about your, you know, respect to your eye doctor, but I don't think that that's a thing. Wear your glasses if you want to see. Well, it's not something that you have to like, oh, no, I'm wearing my glasses too much. That sounds insane to me.

**[00:54:50]** Okay, okay. Spending a lot of time on the eye, but I actually don't mind that.

**[00:55:10]** So that is roughly speaking, most of like the optical stuff that's happening in your eyeball. Like that's where all the refraction stuff happens. Like the bending of the light and the focusing of the image is sort of happening through those kind of like passive means. Well, passive. And the level of the cornea active and sort of mostly reflective in the actual lens part.

**[00:55:41]** And sort of once you get past that, we're kind of in the light has kind of done what it's going to do and you're going to be handle whatever I'm trying to say there. And the rest of it's kind of like up to the, like that's the signal, like the signal from the environmental energy from the world around you. Once it has passed through these sort of optically like, sort of like non neural surfaces, I guess, like they're like this. None of this light is being converted into neural activity. With the caveat being that we're always discovering new weird ways that your body responds to specifically to light.

**[00:56:21]** Like we're off. Like recently there was something discovered of like, oh yeah, there's actually some parts of the eye that respond to blue light differently from the rest that is not a part of the rest of the visual system. And it's thought to be related to like circadian rhythms and stuff like that.

**[00:56:39]** But yeah, so, yeah, so once we get through here, then we start getting into what I would say is kind of like the good stuff from a neuroscience perspective, which is basically the retina. So the retina is this thing on the back of your eye and that is kind of the. That is the neural surface. That is the place where the light from the world is actually first absorbed and converted into neural activity and patterns of neural activity which are correlated with the light that comes through the eye. And the retina is a wacky, wacky thing.

**[00:57:27]** Let's see.

**[00:57:31]** This is a nice picture.

**[00:57:40]** So the first thing we'll talk about, the first thing we'll talk about is the photoreceptors. Photoreceptors means receptors for photons. It's the part of your, of the nervous system. These are the kinds of neurons whose job it is to absorb light and convert it into electrical differentials. In your.

**[00:58:03]** Yeah. In your life, in your eyes, you have to main types, you have rods and cones. And generally speaking, the rods are these. They are rod shaped rods and cones.

**[00:58:33]** Yeah. Yeah.

**[00:58:37]** Oil droplet. I don't know what that is. So yeah, rods, cones.

---

### Chunk 7 [00:58:33 - 01:08:28]

**[00:58:33]** Yeah, yeah.

**[00:58:38]** Oil droplet. I don't know what that is. So, yeah, Rods, Cones. Your rods are, generally speaking, they respond to. They can absorb lower quantities of light, but they tend to max.

**[00:58:54]** They saturate very quickly.

**[00:58:58]** Cones require much more light to operate, but they can operate in a much wider range. So generally speaking, we refer to your cones, sorry, your rods, as the. Generally speaking, your night vision stuff. And then the cones are sort of where your precision. Your precision information.

**[00:59:20]** This is also getting sort of to the depth of my anatomy knowledge. Like, I don't know. This oil drop. That's freaking me out. Like, is that a. I don't know what that's.

**[00:59:29]** This is. This is news to me. But these disks here, I believe that's where the opsins live. Opsin, which we've talked about before. These are the ones, actually.

**[00:59:43]** I think they start kinked, and then as the photons come in, they get absorbed, and that changes the shape of this weird chemical. And the absorption of the photon like bumps the electron into a higher orbital or some nonsense. And then that changes the ionic properties of the thing. And then so that, you know, the. The general status of how many of the opsins in the rod or cone in question have absorb their favorite wavelength of photon changes the electrochemical properties of this whole system.

**[01:00:26]** And so the things that are connected to notice that, okay, this particular rod is ramped up. It's absorbed a lot of its favorite kind of light. And so that's kind of the part of the cascade of neural activity that sort of respect represents your. What's it called? Perceptual experience.

**[01:00:50]** Yeah, and your. I think this varies by animal, but for us, our rods tend to be focused on green. Green is a good color to be sensitive to. On the planet Earth, we have a lot of it sort of floating around. And the cones, or color vision tends to be associated with.

**[01:01:13]** It shows here as red, green, and blue. But it's generally short, medium, and long wavelength of light, where blue is short wavelength, red is long wavelength, and green is somewhere in the middle.

**[01:01:26]** And yeah, they all kind of live there, and they have a certain distribution. And da, da, da. The other thing to notice here is.

**[01:01:39]** So this is the back of the eye. The light is coming this way. And so you might expect that the part of the rods in the cone that is the most sensitive to light would be facing the light. But that is not the way to set up. It is, in fact, the opposite.

**[01:01:58]** And so the cones are facing away from the light. And so light has to pass through all of These middle layers of cells. So there's, you know, after the photoreceptors, you have what are called the middle layers, then you have what are called the ganglion cells. And they are doing all sorts of crazy stuff. They're extremely complex.

**[01:02:21]** And I know there's some. See all these textbook pictures make it look cleaner than it actually is.

**[01:02:33]** Where were we?

**[01:02:39]** But yeah, so our vision, this looks a little better.

**[01:02:45]** So our visual system is backwards. It's the opposite of how you would expect it to be. And there are optical consequences of the fact that everything that we see is, is being imaged through a couple layers of dense cellulature. And that's thought to be related to when we first crawled out of the oceans and the way that the light refracts, because our eyes are very close in density to seawater, whereas they're very different from air. So if you have a visual system that first evolved in an environment that is roughly the same density as your eye, you're going to have to have different sort of refractive strategies where if you have an eye that is sort of basically hold a little bubble of seawater in itself and then it's refracting light that's traveling through an air medium.

**[01:03:40]** So things like cephalopods, octopus, squids, cuttlefish, their eyes are sort of the correct way around. They have very good vision and their photoreceptors actually face out outwards, which is sort of one of those things where it's like, I don't have too much more to say about that other than like, isn't that weird and interesting?

**[01:04:00]** Okay, all right.

**[01:04:05]** It's also kind of funny because it's like, because I have given this lecture many times before, this is also always roughly the time of the lecture where I realized that you need an entire lecture to talk just about the eye. And then I'm really not going to get to say much about the neural parts of the visual cortex, but that's okay. And this is also the part of the lecture where I make peace with that and move on the. Let's see.

**[01:04:33]** So I'll focus on what's important for the eye tracking stuff. So this consequence of strange history of having sort of these like, flipped around retinae. And I'm not going to say too much about what's going on out here, even though it is very interesting and worthy of its own discussion. But if you want to know more, you know, just Google or Astabot about like the middle layers of the retina and then the ganglion Cells of the retina, I'll leave it at that, I guess. But the most important part, I would say, of the entire eye.

**[01:05:21]** My favorite part of the eye, I suppose my favorite part rather than the most important part, I guess, because probably the most important part is the cornea. But that's not very exciting. But my favorite part of the eye is this guy right here, this little divot in the back of the retina that is called your fovea. Fovea is Latin for pit. And it is an area that when you are pointing your eyes at something, the point, the thing that you're actually pointing at the object of interest.

**[01:05:54]** So if you're looking at. Nice cat.

**[01:06:00]** There we go out here, that is pointing at your retina. So the act of pointing my eyes at something is basically lining up all this refractive machinery with this little pit on the back of my eye. And that pit is caused.

**[01:06:45]** Yeah, there's an actual one.

**[01:06:52]** There we go.

**[01:07:00]** Like this guy right here. So basically this is a part of the eye where all the extra stuff has been kind of pushed out of the way to leave an unobstructed viewpoint onto this portion of your eyeball where this is the by very, very wide margin, the highest density of photoreceptors on your eye. So if you look at your eye. So there's many, many ways that your eyes are not cameras. But one of the most important ways is that with a camera you have an equal.

**[01:07:31]** Yeah, look at all these. There's always fun pictures here. Yeah, this is a good representation of how the focusing works. It's like that's you're trying to make constrain the world. It's not showing the refraction at the cornea.

**[01:07:43]** See, this person was too inspired by the lens shape of the lens to understand how that works. So the bending should be happening here and then this should be kind of like extra, but the.

**[01:08:00]** Let's see.

**[01:08:13]** Distribution. So with a camera, the sensor on the back of the camera is roughly equal density of photosensitive, you know, silicone pits. Your eye has.

---

### Chunk 8 [01:08:15 - 01:18:14]

**[01:08:15]** So with a camera, the sensor on the back of the camera is roughly equal density of photosensitive silicone pits. Your eye has a much, much different orientation. So if we're specifically looking at your cones.

**[01:08:43]** There we go.

**[01:08:47]** Yeah. So your cones are the red ones. This is the one that we generally think of as, like, when we think of your. When you think of your vision in terms of like, how good is my vision? You're generally considering that in terms of the behavior and performance of your cones.

**[01:09:01]** And the distributions of cones on the back of your retina looks like this sort of red spike. So this is eccentricity. So zero is on the fovea. And then plus or minus however many degrees. And you can see that like the roughly 50% of your photoreceptors are in that central 1 degree of your eye.

**[01:09:30]** And see photoreceptor density. Trying to find like the right visualization there.

**[01:09:54]** Oh, yeah, that's. That's what I'm looking for.

**[01:10:17]** Yeah, sure. So if you were to look into the back of your retina and sort of count up all of the photoreceptors, you would find the vast, vast, vast majority of them, like, very densely packed in that foveal, central region of your eye. So that when you are sort of pointing your eyes around, you're trying to optimize your eye movements to point this super high, super densely packed region of photoreceptors at the object in question. And that is also the area where they sort of. That core sort of design foible of the retina is sort of then sort of mitigated by sort of being.

**[01:11:07]** By pushing all the stuff out of the way. Something else you might notice about this is the.

**[01:11:20]** Is the cones also. So the rods, which are now these purple. That's your sort of. That's your peripheral vision. And they are highly.

**[01:11:34]** Their distribution is sort of spread out to the periphery, which is thought to be for a lot of reasons. Because these things respond to smaller amounts of light, they tend to respond faster. So for things like peripheral cues, mostly when we're thinking about our peripheral vision, its job is not to give us precise sort of like, I can read text levels of vision. It's to give us very fast information about stuff that's sort of coming in from the outside. So that's kind of like the startle response and stuff like that, where, like, things that are sort of like looming objects from the outside trigger a behavioral response.

**[01:12:06]** And that's often driven by the rods. This is also why, if you're ever out in like the dead of night, looking at the stars. If you want to see something when your eyes are very, very dark adapted, the best way to see something is not to look directly at it, because in the middle of the night, your rods aren't really working very well. So if you look directly at something, you're going to be getting less light than you want. So astronomers learn that if you're interested in a particular star, the best way to see it is to look a little bit off to the side of it and then let your, your rods do the work of giving you the information of what's coming in.

**[01:12:47]** So next time you're out in a nice starry night, you will try that out. Yeah. Seven sisters of Pleiades, or Pleiades, are sort of like one of. That's something I've noticed this effect a lot on, because it's like a very small sort of cluster of stars where if I'm looking directly at it, I can't make out the individual stars. But if I look a little bit off the side, I start to be able to count that there's seven of them.

**[01:13:14]** And for there, a lot of the challenge is looking not directly at the thing that you care the most about, which is its own kind of like mental game that we can sort of probably not talk too much about.

**[01:13:32]** So, and this is also where, now that I've sort of talked about some of these structural aspects of the eye, and the retina can try to be strategic about what I cover with the rest of this. They got through a lot of this stuff.

**[01:14:09]** Now focus on the thing.

**[01:14:13]** So we've been talking a lot about the eyes as kind of like in terms of its passive optical properties. Like, the light bends here and is absorbed by this and the kind of like these photoreceptors there, that kind of thing. But, you know, a lot of what we wind up doing with our eyes is shaped by that and specifically in the context of, like, eye movements, because we do move our eyes, we move our eyes quite a lot. This is again, one of those things that is. It's not unique to humans, but I mean, every animal, I'd say most animals, actually not every animal, but most animals do move their eyes.

**[01:15:00]** But humans and other primates of our general nature, haplorine primates, I believe, is the name of the family that we're in, not family, whatever group.

**[01:15:13]** Our nervous system is very heavily geared around our vision, and our vision is very heavily geared towards our ability to move our eyes very rapidly and very precisely. In order to extract, in order to point those super high acuity regions of our fovea at the things that we care about with very high speed and very high sort of spatial accuracy.

**[01:15:38]** Your eye, each of your eyes has six muscles on it.

**[01:15:52]** So you have two muscle. This is my eye, and this is like the front of my eye. I have two muscles on the top and bottom whose job it is to move the eye up and down, and two muscles on the side that move the eye left and right. And then two weirdo muscles at the top and bottom whose job is to rotate your eye sort of like around its optical axis. That's called torsional eye movements.

**[01:16:18]** And it's the kind of thing. I'll be able to show this to you when I'm wearing an eye tracker, but it happens all the time. Like, your eyes, if you do this, your eyes are rotating in their optical axis not a ton. These muscles here pass through. Like the one on the bottom comes in from the bottom, and the one on the top passes through this ligamentous sling.

**[01:16:52]** So there's like a little ligament that sort of like loops around this superior oblique muscle that attaches to the top of your eye and allows it to kind of rotate that way. And so a lot of what we're going to like, when I put the eye tracker on, you see the eyeball bouncing around on the screen. The majority of those eye movements are just stabilizing my head, like, stabilizing against the motion of my head. Because if I'm moving my head around, which we move our heads a lot, the opsin thing, like the part where the opsin absorbs the light, is a relatively slow process. It's not slow to absorb it, but it's slow to reset.

**[01:17:30]** Like, there's a process, there's a biochemical process in your eye after that opsin has absorbed in that photon, that basically has to go through and reset the opsin until it can absorb light again. And that's mediated by, like, vitamin A or something like that. And it takes time. So you've seen this before. Like, if you look at a light, then you look away, you can see an after image of that light in your vision.

**[01:17:53]** And that's because those opsons have absorbed photons. And then it's going to take time for them to reset. And until they do, you can no longer absorb light from that portion of your visual field because it's sort of been maxed out.

**[01:18:10]** So because of that, you have to be able to stabilize.

### Chunk 9 [01:18:00 - 01:27:59]

**[01:18:00]** Time for them to reset. And until they do, you can no longer absorb light from that portion of your visual field because it's sort of been maxed out.

**[01:18:10]** So because of that, there's kind of like, there's like. You have to be able to stabilize your eyeball in sort of relative to the world in order for it to have time to form an image from the light. That's sort of making it through this complicated sort of processed to make it back to your retina. And so a lot of the purpose of eye movements is just to act as like stabilization of your eye and the world. And that happens sort of simultaneously to another process of information gathering, eye movements where I can actually move my eyes to specific places because I care about the information that's from that portion of my visual field.

**[01:18:56]** And.

**[01:19:01]** Yeah, and we'll have much more to say about that when we actually are looking at eyeballs closely.

**[01:19:12]** Yeah, it's very complicated and very, very fast. Very fast, very precise. Your eyeballs are the fastest and most precise motor structures on your body. When you're doing sort of like fast interesting behavior, where that could be like walking across a rocky field or something like that, or like playing sports or playing video games, Something that requires very fast and precise visual information, you're making eye movements at the rate of about 1 every 150 milliseconds or so at the sort of fast, that's the fastest they can go. And that is roughly like the minimum time that it takes for the image, like the neural architecture, to sort of extract information from that pipeline.

**[01:20:01]** And so most of the times they're not making imovies nearly that fast, but they can go up to that speed. And this can happen while your body is sort of like you're jumping and running around through the world. And as you run, your head is sort of bobbing around. So there's a very complex machinery of gaze stabilization such that sort of information gathering. Saccades, or a saccade is the name of a fast eye movement happen sort of on top of those stabilization mechanisms that are sort of allowing your eye to be still long enough to absorb the information necessary to form an image also.

**[01:20:51]** So there's a lot of, a lot of the field of vision, vision, like visual neuroscience and stuff like that involves looking at illusions and learning about what the illusions say about our visual system. And so like, for example, when you were asking about like peripheral vision, it's like, oh, that's happening at this other part of the. Of the eye, not the cornea. There are similarly Illusions that we can distribute to different parts of the visual system. So one of them, which you may have seen.

**[01:21:45]** Yeah, this one always messes me up severely.

**[01:21:52]** Oops, not that one. It.

**[01:22:29]** No, no, no.

**[01:22:32]** So this is called a Herrmann grid, which if you look at it, you'll probably be seeing little ghosty black dots. So when you look at a dot, it's white. The dots are all white, but the ones that you're not looking at are going to be a different color.

**[01:22:54]** Similarly, this is another one of those classics where all the intersections are white. I promise you, they're all white, but if you look at them, you'll probably see little shadowy ghosty shapes in the corners of the other ones. For a while, some of them. One generation of MacBook had this effect on the keyboard, but I think they probably fixed that.

**[01:23:36]** And this is basically caused by.

**[01:23:44]** There we go.

**[01:23:47]** This one messes me up.

**[01:23:56]** Come on.

**[01:23:59]** Okay, so it's not.

**[01:24:05]** Why don't we have these things?

**[01:24:13]** Yeah, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

**[01:24:24]** This one has the effect that you cannot.

**[01:24:29]** Come on. I don't know if it works for the artifact there, but like if you just Google Hermann grid, 12 dots. Like, this is one of the things that gets hard to display these things on a screen because they don't always work out. But you can't see all of them at once because of basically interactions with your ganglion cells, which have ganglion retina cells. This is a layer that I'm not.

**[01:24:56]** I just don't have the. There's a lot. This is a layer that I just can't quite get to. The ganglion cells have to do with like the pooling that happens where it's kind of like. It's this.

**[01:25:13]** This layer where the photoreceptors from the different are kind of. They get pooled together and sort of respond like, you know, they wind up becoming one.

**[01:25:26]** What's it called? Nerve coming off the back of your retina. So like that's an area where in the central of your visual field, like at that fovea region, you. It's almost a one to one mapping where almost every photoreceptor has an axon coming down and going back through your optic nerve. But around the periphery, the signals from multiple receptors, they get pooled together.

**[01:25:51]** And so a lot of these effects happen because of the interactions in that. Because if you're looking at the dot in question, you see it correctly, but then the periphery is doing pooling over that region of the retinal field. So the whiteness of this dot gets sort of, like, mixed in with the darkness of the surrounding regions. And so your brain sort of interprets it as being a different color than it is. And then when you move your eye towards it now, it looks white, but the thing you were looking at has this other effect.

**[01:26:24]** And let's see if this site is still running. So Fovea Shader, and this is one of my favorite versions of that phove detector, so it's working for me. So every one of these crosses is rotating the entire time. But if you're looking at it, tell me if this is working from your perspective. Like, only the part that you're looking at should have rotation, and the rest of them look still.

**[01:26:58]** Is that working? Yeah, that's because of your fovea and because your fovea is so much more sensitive than the other. If you just Google Fovea Detector Shader Toy, you'll find this. And it looks better on your screen, but it's one of these areas where, like, your ability to identify the motion is. This is designed to be kind of like at your threshold of your ability to do it.

**[01:27:28]** And so the only portion of the screen where you can actually see the motion is at that foveal place. So the effect is a very strange. Like, as you look around, it will look like there's only, like, a little patch of it that's rotating, and that that patch will follow wherever you choose to point your eyes.

**[01:27:50]** It's very. Yeah. Someday, whoever is hosting this site will stop hosting it, and I'll be sad. Oh, but also, that's funny.

### Chunk 10 [01:27:45 - 01:31:14]

**[01:27:45]** Wherever you choose to point your eyes.

**[01:27:50]** It's very. Someday, whoever is hosting this site will stop hosting it and I'll be sad. Oh, but also, that's funny. The first time I found this is like, I couldn't interpret the code, but now I'm better at that. So I'm like, oh, I know how to.

**[01:28:05]** I can pull this into my own life and have more control over it.

**[01:28:14]** Yeah, yeah. So the point is that your vision is complicated. It's complicated before it even hits your brain. There is a sort of interesting. When I talked at some point about, like, peripheral versus central nervous system, I mentioned the retina, or if I intended to mention the retina as kind of like a gray area there, because there's very easy to discuss.

**[01:28:43]** Like, when you're talking about. Oftentimes you talk about central versus peripheral nervous system, you're talking about the context of, like, which part is doing processing, which part of it is just sort of like funneling the information either to or from the central nervous system. And the retina is one of those cases where, like, it would really be hard to argue that what's happening in this sort of like, middle layers of the retina wouldn't count as processing. And a lot, because the effects that I just showed you, those illusions I just showed you, those are all at that sort of like, those illusions happen before the light and the neural activity driven by the light ever leaves your eye. Oh, another visual effect.

**[01:29:26]** Just look up your blind spot, too. Just do me a favor and just pretend like I did that in class. Just look up. Just Google blind spot demo and then do the thing where you learn how to find the blind spot where your thumb disappears and then just have feelings about that. But, yeah, so the eye is a very complicated thing.

**[01:29:48]** And the eyeball itself, there's a lot going on there.

**[01:29:57]** We're going to talk a little. I'll find time to talk more about the kind of the primary visual cortex layer of things, which is typically where when we think about visual processing, we're thinking about something that's happening in the brain. And sort of like. And there is a good chunk of our brain is devoted to vision. And in this sort of visual cortex area, roughly 50% of the visual cortex is devoted towards that central 1 degree of your fovea.

**[01:30:31]** Your fovea, by the way, is about the size of your thumbnail at arm's length. So about 50% of your visual cortex, 50% of your photoreceptors, and 50% of your visual cortex are devoted to processing this much of your visual field. So it's about 1% of your visual field is about 50%. About 50% of your architecture of your visual system is devoted to that 1% of your visual field field. And that kind of is to make the point that it's the ability to move the eyes as precisely as we do that gives them the ability to operate and to guide our motor behavior as effectively as it can.

**[01:31:08]** And that is the end of the class. Next Wednesday, I will come in with.
