### Chunk 1 [00:00:00 - 00:10:00]

**[00:00:00]** We're recording now. So to repeat that the proper assignment, like the proper proper like poster proposal assignment will be on like a one or two sentence write up on the topic area that you're going to want your poster to be on and a singular citation of a paper that kind of represents what that research, what, what that like research in the area that you're going to be presenting on the standard assignment for 2299 is that you're supposed to pick a singular paper for the whole semester and then your poster is going to be you presenting just that paper. I think we can go a little bit beyond that if that's all you want to do. That's totally valid. But I think we can do a little bit more broad of an overview.

**[00:00:50]** And but to keep us kind of honest, I'm going to ask you to pick a singular paper and then the BOT mediated conversation will be sort of designed to help you do that. So if you give it say, here's the topic I want to study, here's the paper I'm thinking about, here's the abstract I'll make the BOT prompted to kind of like ask you the kind of questions that, you know, I would ask you if I have the time and energy to kind of sit down and talk about it behind the curtain. When they talk about this class, most of what they tell us to do is try to help you guys not pick a review article for your paper and to pick an actual proper like empirical research article. Like, because it's really, it's like if you just go search for papers on a given topic, you're going to find review articles at the top of that list. And it's not always super obvious whether you're looking at a review article or a book chapter or an empirical study.

**[00:01:55]** So I can tell the BOT to help you with that and they'll do things like asking you about the methodologies and topics and stuff like that. So just kind of like helping you kind of parse the very, very dense language that an abstract or a scientific paper is typically written in. And so then there will be some sort of simple checkboxy style of canvas assignment and then like a discord server based conversations based there. And those will be ostensibly due next week. So end of next week, meaning 11:59pm on Sunday for the following Monday.

**[00:02:33]** And if you don't hit that deadline, there will be dire consequences. Not really, but it's sort of, we wanted to keep kind of in that general cadence that we're all kind of like on the Same path.

**[00:02:49]** Do, do, do. And probably by the end of this next week is when the. I will have implemented the stuff where the bot will be kind of like keeping track of a profile of your interests and kind of like help in the journey that you will take through this general field.

**[00:03:12]** But we'll see. Anytime I make a promise about the future, just know internally I am screaming.

**[00:03:28]** Great.

**[00:03:34]** Okay.

**[00:03:48]** Yes. Okay, let's go ahead and get into it.

**[00:03:57]** I want to do methods. I realize I forgot mocap, eye tracking, etc. Okay.

**[00:04:21]** I also forgot a piece of equipment that I intended to bring today, so I will use this instead.

**[00:04:33]** Someone doesn't know how to.

**[00:04:37]** Great, that works.

**[00:04:40]** Alrighty.

**[00:04:48]** Okay, so let us begin the lecture proper.

**[00:04:58]** So it's been nice for the first part of this class kind of seeing you guys talking about your interest in the server, kind of talking to the bot about what you're into and what you want to study and things like that. And I intentionally wanted to have the. That part happen first before I kind of talk too much about my own particular map of this space, because I didn't want to.

**[00:05:30]** I wanted to let you guys kind of like think about it for yourselves before I came up and did the traditional professor thing, which is to tell you, here's what this field is and here's what this means, and here's what is on topic, here's what is off topic. Because I generally don't think that that's how we should think about intellectual inquiry. In the next chunk of time, I'm going to give you an overview of this domain of human centered neuroscience that is mostly related to my own particular history, my own research background, my own. The studies that I've done. And anytime that you, by the time that you have sort of lived long enough to have specialties and personal experiences and whatnot, you will have sort of charted your own path and trajectory into the heart of some field or some domain.

**[00:06:27]** And for pretty much all of you, for everyone that sort of chooses to follow a route kind of like that, you are going to have a sort of unique path. Like everybody's path is going to be different and everybody's sort of. The topics that are relevant to everybody's interest will be different. So I don't want to present this stuff in the sense that. In the sense of saying here is everything that matters, here is everything that is relevant to this topic.

**[00:07:00]** I really want to keep it kind of on that relatively personalized narrative of these are the topics that are the most important for. For me to be able to study human perceptual motor neuroscience in the ways that I specifically have learned how to do and sort of talking about that in that context of the component pieces of my particular specialty. And I think the beauty of using sort of AI mediated tools in a classroom setting is that in a traditional class, the professor kind of like lays out the curriculum, lays out the structure, lays out the topic area, and then you are all kind of constrained to follow that structure. And that's largely for practical reasons. Like it's just too hard and it requires too much human labor to like really mediate and like sort of navigate the particular sort of variations of interest of people and even a room that is labeled under a particular course title.

**[00:08:08]** But I think with the AI, limited though it may be, it will always do its damnedest to make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics that I have mandated it should care about. So as I start going through this stuff, just encouraging you to really learn to key in to like, your own personal feelings of interest and your own personal feelings of like, being drawn or snagged or moved by some topic or some domain. And you know, if you want to follow the trajectories that I'm doing, that's all well and good, but even if you wanted to, you wouldn't, it wouldn't happen that way because that's not how the world works. And so as I give this sort of lecture, my main request for you is to just not let your brain turn all the way off. I'm going to be talking fast about a lot of sort of topics that are going to be relatively unfamiliar.

**[00:09:15]** For some of them, they might be the first time you've heard about it. For some of them, you might have heard about it before.

**[00:09:21]** The goal is not to have you understand everything that I'm saying. The goal is to just expose you to it. So as I start sort of blah, blah, blahing at you, don't get too hung up on whether or not you're following everything. Just kind of like remember the words as much as you can. Try to let, just try to let it wash over you.

**[00:09:42]** I promise you, non zero of it will be attaching. And then when we kind of open things back up, you can start asking the bot, asking your neighbors the questions about the parts that were the most interesting to you and the part that I have found the most.

---

### Chunk 2 [00:09:45 - 00:19:44]

**[00:09:45]** It will be attaching. And then when we kind of open things back up, you can start asking the bot, asking your neighbors the questions about the parts that were the most interesting to you. And the part that I have found the most gratifying about doing this type of a class is the discovery, every time, empirically, that when I give a lecture on a given topic and then I say to 40 students, asked a bot about the parts you found most interesting, typically what I see from that is 40 different conversations about 40 different topics. And that's really a lot of fun.

**[00:10:25]** So with that said, let us get into it. Unfortunately, I brought. I intended to bring a, like a tablet so I could like, draw, like, stuff with colors, and I brought the tablet. But then when I looked for like the pen part, I found I just thrown like this like standard pencil into here, which I can't even. I can't even imagine what was going on when I did that.

**[00:10:59]** So we're just doing. We're gonna do it old school with unfortunately, just a singular color. But that's okay.

**[00:11:07]** Let's see. Move over here.

**[00:11:13]** So it was your fault.

**[00:11:21]** How dare you. Okay, I'll just. I'll put it on your bill.

**[00:11:32]** Okay, so.

**[00:11:36]** Right. So the topic of the course is neuroscience. The department is biology. And most of you, as biology majors and whatnot, have internalized to some degree or another with validity that biology and neuroscience are things, is related to things like cells and neurons and wet lab microscope types of conversations and stuff like that. Super valid, super good topics, good things to look at, and all kind of part and parcel with a particular philosophical tradition that is so fundamental to the way that we do scientific research in 2025 in Earth that we often don't even think about it.

**[00:12:25]** And that is the concept of reductionism that's known your way. So reductionism is just sort of a general philosophical approach to the study of the natural world, which tries to break things down into smaller and smaller pieces so that you can sort of make more and more precise measurements and more and more precise topics, more precise investigations. But it's kind of like sort of like implicit assumption that at some point there will be. That by looking at the component pieces of the world, you'll be able to get a sense of the holistic view of how everything works. And there's a lot of validity to that approach.

**[00:13:04]** But there's also obviously a lot of limitations to that, because if you're only looking at the small pieces in isolation, you are never going to see or you're going to Have a hard time seeing what we call emergent properties, which are things that only really come about when you look at the combination of things at a larger scale than the kinds of things you can put into a test tube and under a microscope. The classic example of emergence is traffic. So traffic is a property of cars on a road, but you can never understand traffic by looking at a singular car. It's something that only really comes about when you're looking at the cars operating in their natural environment.

**[00:13:48]** And so, you know, the counter to reductionism is you might call more holism or something like that. But that tends to be the scale that my sort of research domain tends to operate in. I tend not to be like, I look at the research of the people who are doing the highly reduced, sort of like electrophysiology studies where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals, fmri, where they have people in a tube and they're looking at the magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin in their brain.

**[00:14:25]** But my particular domain of research tends to focus on humans behaving in natural environments, doing the kinds of stuff that we do in our sort of day to day lives. So throwing things in the air and catching them involves there's a motor behavior of putting force into the marker, an information gathering phase and then another motor command which if it lines up with the world, works out. If it doesn't, I drop it. And largely sort of trying to understand that behavioral process in its natural context and then trying to use whatever the best measurements that I can come up with of those behaviors and, and then trying to attach them to sort of the more low level reductionist sort of fields of inquiry so that we can have a sense of how things like cells and neurons can lead to complex behaviors like that. So I think of it as kind of like it's almost like a robotics approach.

**[00:15:33]** So I like to tell people that I study the part of neuroscience that overlaps with robotics because robotics is another field that kind of like keeps you honest in the sense that it's. You make things that move around in the real world. So you can't really cut that many corners. So the thing just stops working. And the difference is that the like robots, we know how they work because we made them, but we, they can't do all the things we want.

**[00:16:00]** Humans, we don't really know how they work, but they can do pretty much anything. So there's this kind of combination of those two, sort of, sort of thinking about the human as like a magical meat robot and trying to study it and understand it from that perspective can lead to a lot of useful results.

**[00:16:20]** And the nice thing about that is kind of the abstraction away from the biology and from the knowledge that it is, in fact, under the hood, cells and neurons and membrane potentials and things like that. And thinking about it more in the terms of the things that we can measure, which we will talk about shortly.

**[00:16:45]** So let's talk. So speaking of the natural world, let's sort of talk about something which is one of the ways to parse out that general topic, which is what's called the perception action cycle.

**[00:17:02]** So let's start by drawing a brain. I'm trying to draw it.

**[00:17:19]** Yes. Let's do it like that. So here's how you draw a brain.

**[00:17:26]** There you go.

**[00:17:32]** The.

**[00:17:36]** Sorry.

**[00:17:39]** You'll figure it out. Okay, so this is your brain. This is a picture of your brain. That's your temporal lobe, this is your eye. You're facing that way.

**[00:17:52]** And there's a lot of details that are not being covered here, but this is the general shape. So here you are, that's you. And you exist in the world. And let's see, let's do this a different way.

**[00:18:23]** There you go, that's you. You're in the world. And here's your body, here's your eye, here's your mouth. And then inside of there, that's your brain, not to scale. And so as you are in the world, you have a very limited awareness of your given context.

**[00:18:49]** And everything that you know comes in through your senses and, well, your senses and your memory. So let's think about a particular moment in time where you're sitting here, you have your eye, and then you see out here, there's a cat. You like cats. And so you. So the image of light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye.

**[00:19:20]** And we'll talk a lot about eyes. We'll talk about the lens, we'll talk about the retina, we'll talk about the fovea, we'll talk about the optic nerve. But the most. The main thing is that there's. Your eye is the place where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system.

**[00:19:41]** And this moment right here.

---

### Chunk 3 [00:19:31 - 00:29:30]

**[00:19:31]** But the main thing is that your eye is the place where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system. And this moment right here is a very special moment in your perceptual cycle, which is the moment of transduction, which is the term for the moment when some form of environmental energy, in this case light, gets transduced and converted into neural activity. In this particular case, in your. This is your eye. The light goes in.

**[00:20:11]** It goes into your retina, into your fovea, which talk plenty about. There's a particular class of molecule called opsins. Opsins look roughly like this. This is like, you know, what are they called? Carbons and hydrogens, and then the hexagon and then the lungs, the long sort of wiggly tail, the people in biochemistry.

**[00:20:43]** This is probably familiar shapes, except this is not drawn well. And then you have a bunch of these opsins in your eye, and they're all. There's basically three main ones, and they're sort of. They're all. They are tuned, if you want to use that term, to different wavelengths of light.

**[00:21:01]** And the nature of them is that when a photon of light hits them, they absorb the energy of that photon and then change shape. And I think I actually did this backwards. I think they start out with the kink, and then when they absorb the light, they straighten out. But whatever happens, this absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule. And it goes from being a neutral to a plus one or a minus one or whatever it is.

**[00:21:34]** But the point is that the light that is coming from the environment, bouncing off the cat entering your eye, changing the chemical layout of the opsin and happening in the trillions and billions of sort of instances that biology tends to operate in, this changes the polarity and the electrical state of the rods and the cones in your retina, which get sort of, you know, accumulated with ganglia and various sort of other stuff, and leads to a shift in the electrical potential in that section of your retina that then gets sent in as spikes down your optic nerves. Neurons are the things that neuroscience is made of. And mostly what neurons do is they spike. They send little electrical pulses, and that's how they communicate that whatever that neuron has tuned to has occurred. And for perception, for vision, it's this absorption of light into the opsin and the shift in this polarity and then the change in that electrical state that leads to a change in the.

**[00:22:53]** What's the term, the spike rate of a given ganglion cell as it is sending its axon down the optic nerve into Your optic, the occipital lobe, and the visual cortex.

**[00:23:15]** And so we're going to talk more about this in more detail and more coherence. But the important thing here is that the light that has been absorbed by your eye, that is then gets converted through this strange biochemical machine into a pattern of neural activity. Because the neural activity is caused by the light, and because the light has been reflected off the object in question, there is a general belief and assumption that the pattern of neural activity has somehow has some relationship with the object in the real world. There's some statistical correlation. There's some relationship.

**[00:23:58]** And the pattern of neural activity somehow encodes information about the world that you're looking at.

**[00:24:07]** The nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex and, generally speaking, extremely impoverished. Like, the actual information we're getting in any one moment in time is far less than you think it would be. It's a lot. But the richness of your visual environment, for example, is very much an illusion based off of your brain's ability to sort of cobble together a lot of noisy information to give you something that's sort of accurate enough to move through the world, but often and almost exclusively designed. Sort of like after the fact that.

**[00:24:44]** So that's your brain again. It's more like a macaque brain, but that's fine. So your optic. So the light comes into your eye, gets absorbed by the retina, which is on the back of your eye, sends a pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve, passes through some subcortical areas in the thalamus and stuff like that, which we'll talk about. Not that much about that part, but there is some stuff that happens here.

**[00:25:14]** And then projects down to the occipital lobe, which is otherwise known as the visual cortex, which is in the back of your brain.

**[00:25:25]** Not super important to know where it is, but it's just kind of like one of those things, like vision happens here in the back for whatever reason.

**[00:25:40]** And so this is the place where the first kind of like the first pass of information about your visual environment sort of starts to get computed. And it's mostly in the form of, like, edges and dark patches, light patches and stuff like that. And once you get from V1, which. Which is primary visual cortex, it goes through other stages of processing that lead to more and more complex structures to emerge. So you start with things like edges, and then if you have enough edges, you can get patches, and if you get patches, then you can get textures.

**[00:26:25]** And if you get textures, you can get objects and that sort of, like, each stage of visual processing builds on the stage before to sort of eventually lead to the ability to do things like object recognition of, like, oh, that thing out there is a cat. There's a conversation we can have about the parts of that process that go down. This lobe, which is your temporal lobe, which is here, tends to be the sort of object space of like, that's a desk, that's a computer. And then the part that we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up this direction, which tends to be more in tune of using that information to plan your movement out in the world.

**[00:27:17]** Something that I haven't said I think yet, but probably but is something that bears repeating is obviously, this is a cartoon. This is a very abstracted, simplified version of a story which if you wanted to tell the whole story, you would have to tell 1,000 stories of 1,000 thousand humans in their labs recording data, getting a bunch of numbers, and then making up their own stories in the discussion sections of their own papers about what the different parts mean. And. And then this kind of cartoonified story is the version that tends to make it into the textbooks that we then sort of communicate back to you and sort of try to make sense out of any of it. But I think it's really important that we remember that this is not the real story.

**[00:28:03]** This is the cartoon. And the real story is something that we don't actually have access to. There is no level of class where I can just give you the book that says, here is what the visual cortex is actually doing. The best I could ever do is just to give you a record of all the empirical measurements that all the humans who have ever investigated this managed to put together, and then tell you the story that we have collectively decided is the best story that we can come up with for how we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside of all of our skulls is. Is operating.

**[00:28:44]** But, yeah, but that's not.

**[00:28:49]** There is a gap in a central gap between epistemology, which is our knowledge of things, and metaphysics, which is what actually exists. And the two things never truly touch. There is always going to be a difference between knowing something and. And what that thing actually is. And in the history of science, we have told many, many, many stories about what we think is going on in the world and in our bodies and in our goopy bits.

**[00:29:20]** And historically, over time, every single one of those stories, on a long enough time scale, is proven wrong in some sense. Everything we currently think will eventually be proven wrong.

---

### Chunk 4 [00:29:15 - 00:39:15]

**[00:29:15]** In the world and in our bodies and in our goopy bits. And historically, over time, every single one of those stories, on a long enough time scale, is proven wrong in some sense. Everything we currently think will eventually be proven wrong in some way or another. Evidence for that being, everything we've ever thought up until this point has been proven wrong in some way or another. So as you think, there's something special about today that's going to keep happening indefinitely until the sun burns out.

**[00:29:46]** But the beauty of the scientific process in some sense, is that we have this belief that even though everything has been wrong, there is a sense that each successive idea is less wrong than the one before it. And less wrong means that it allows us to make more precise predictions, it allows us to heal sickness better, it allows us to build machines that do more exciting things. Sometimes those improvements happen by completely throwing out philosophical, sort of like base level beliefs about how certain things work. But yeah, it's a continuous process. We'll talk about it.

**[00:30:32]** Yes. So here we are on this cycle. The light has bounced off the cat, it's hit your eye, it's been absorbed, it's been transmitted back to your visual cortex. You have identified that it's a cat. And you have an inbuilt volition that says, I like to touch cats.

**[00:30:56]** Great. We support this for you. So the parietal lobe. Don't worry about the parietal lobe. It's great, but you can worry about it if you want.

**[00:31:11]** But the important sort of do, do, do, do, do. Okay, so this back here is your visual cortex. This on the side here, roughly speaking, is your motor cortex. And so eventually you start, as you look in more and more pictures of the brain, you will, you can look at this directly. The wrinkles and stuff on the brain are not random.

**[00:31:41]** They are conserved. In the same sense that while every face that we have looks very different, they generally have two eyes and a nose and a mouth and just in different kind of configurations. The wrinkly stuff and the crevices and bumps and stuff on our brain are roughly the same. Like, if you were to crack open all the brain in this room, which I don't recommend, you would find a lot of correspondence in where the big creases and stuff come in. And I am not at the level of that anatomy where I can name them off the top of my head, but I do recognize them in pictures.

**[00:32:19]** And that's how you can kind of. It's easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain artistically versus when they're looking at anatomy because artists and whatnot often just say, oh, yeah, it's a bunch of like, pink wrinkles. And then you just sort of. It's like, okay, well, that's not. That's not actually how we do.

**[00:32:36]** But anyways, there's a big one right in the mirror called the central sulcus. Sulcus is like the crease part. And on this side of that sulcus is the somatosensory cortex. Somatosensation is like, basically touch, like this type of sensation. And on that side is the motor cortex.

**[00:32:57]** So the somatosensory cortex and the motor cortex, and they tend to be paired. And you can look up. We'll look up the homunculi when we talk about the motor cortex.

**[00:33:14]** But I kind of. I enjoy this distinction. And sort of like, there's these two sides of the brain where on this side of the brain, it's kind of like sensation and sort of the perception of the world, like visual aspects and the sort of sensory aspects. And then on this side of the brain is where we start getting to motor actions and movements and kind of the outgoing parts of things. And as we sort of keep going forward, you eventually get over here to the frontal lobes.

**[00:33:43]** The frontal lobe is like the big lumpy part in the front. That's the. The most human part of the brain. All mammalian brains are roughly the sort of same anatomically. They're just very funhouse mirrored into different sort of shapes and sizes.

**[00:34:00]** Like, you know, rats have a much more pronounced olfactory bulb for smell versus their visual cortex. And the human brain has a lot of extra anatomy on that frontal lobe area. This is thought to be kind of where decision making comes from. This is where language kind of lives. And often it's referenced in executive function.

**[00:34:27]** So the feeling of deciding what you want to do, this is also where metacognition happens. So if you're having thoughts about your thoughts, like, oh, yeah, I'm angry right now. That's a frontal lobby area. And just reiterating the point, Every time I point to a part of the brain and I say, this is the part that does this thing, a little part of me inside is screaming and dying. Because none of this is how any of it, like, that's the cartoon.

**[00:34:56]** That's not how the real world is set up. It's much more complex than that. It's much noisier than that. But if I say this is where executive function happens, and I point at the front of the brain, and this is where vision happens and I point at the back of the brain. That statement is more true than if I switched those two things around.

**[00:35:14]** So just. It's important to reiterate that even though I am telling you these simplified stories, these sort of textbook level conversations about how the brain is, this is the stuff that if we come back to this class in 250 years, we're going to be saying very, very different things, but we'll probably still say something like the vision happens in the back and the cognition happens in the front. Anyways, from this frontal lobe, from the. You get sort of the frontal area, executive functions, and then you get your premotor area. And somewhere around here is where volitions arise.

**[00:35:50]** Volition is sort of same root as voluntary. It's like the things that you want to do. So you see, you see the cat and you say, I want to touch the cat. Cat. Here is the cat and look at me, I'm touching it.

**[00:36:06]** And that's. This is what I want to happen. And so now you are in this state where here's your body here, here's your hand there, here's this cat there, and here's this desire that I sure wish that my hand part was on this cat part and this sort of. And now there's a gap between the way that the world is in your perception and the way that you wish the world to be, which is that your hand was sort of touching this object. Okay, so those volitions kind of meld with the perceptual experience.

**[00:36:45]** And from this sort of alchemy emerges something resembling a motor plant.

**[00:36:56]** I'm trying to stop myself from going to some of these details because I am going to have. We're going to have a whole lecture about the eye. We're going to have a whole lecture about the motor cortex. We're going to talk about this in more detail. I'm just giving the overview.

**[00:37:13]** But this is where we would call something. The first time we start seeing something resembling a motor plan. There's a lot of times in the chats y' all have been having where you talk about things like muscle memory, which is the sort of muscle memory is kind of like the. It's a term we like to use. It's like a very standard human expression.

**[00:37:36]** But it's also one of the things that's like. It doesn't really exist in a physiological sense. Like your mo. Your muscles don't have memory. They're a much simpler object.

**[00:37:44]** Which we will talk about muscles too. Usually what you mean when you say muscle memory is motor plan. And as you sort of work on something more and more, you get more expertise and more experience. That what we tend to refer to as muscle memory is really like the motor plans kind of becoming more robust and more sort of locked in.

**[00:38:10]** And typically, where a lot of that kind of motor planning takes place is not necessarily in the motor cortex, but most of that starts happening in subcortical regions. So if you think about a picture of the brain and you think about that pink, wrinkly thing in your skull, that tends to be what we think about. That's your cortex. That's the neocortex. It's the part where most of the processing happens, which we'll talk a little about what processing means in this context.

**[00:38:47]** But it is. I like to talk about this as like, that is the. That's kind of like the bloom of the rose on the rose bush. Like, when you think about the nervous system and you're looking at. When you're looking at a rose bush, it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose, like the red thing with petals, and that smells nice.

**[00:39:09]** And we spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant, and for a very good reason. But if you really.

### Chunk 5 [00:39:00 - 00:49:00]

**[00:39:00]** System. And you're looking at, when you're looking at a rose bush, it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose, like the red thing with petals and that smells nice. And we spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant and for a very good reason. But if you really take a step back and look at it from a botany point of view, it's mostly bush and just a little bit of rose. And I think that's.

**[00:39:24]** It's kind of the same with the way our cortex works. The majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex. It's in the subcortical regions. And among my favorite of those subcortical regions is the cerebellum, which it looks sort of sits at this, looks kind of like this fist shaped thing that sits right below your cortex. When you look up pictures of the brain online, you'll see the big pink, wrinkly thing.

**[00:39:49]** You see this kind of more dense, sort of like grayish looking thing underneath it. That's your cerebellum. Your cerebellum is a very complicated beast.

**[00:40:01]** It contains about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined. And that number is sort of strangely conserved across different animals. Like all animals, mammals particular, just because I don't know about the other guys, we all have cortex, we all have cerebellum. We have very different brain to body ratios and different sort of proportions there. But in general, however big your brain is, whatever animal you are, your cerebellum has three and a half times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex, which is one of those things.

**[00:40:41]** Like I always sort of come back to that. It's sort of like that just seems anytime you find a number in nature that's conserved across a bunch of different stasis, it's just kind of like that seems like an interesting thing. I wish I knew more about it. So your cerebellum, part of the reason why it has so many more neurons by count is that the neurons associated with it are teensy, teensy tiny. You have granule cells and you have purkinje cells.

**[00:41:10]** I will tell look up pictures because it's perkinje cells.

**[00:41:22]** Oh, do I have Internet here?

**[00:41:28]** Yeah, yeah. Purkinje cells in your cerebellum are like one of the more beautiful parts of the nervous, of your, of your brain. It's kind of, you have the cell body, you have the axon, and then these are all the synapses and all of there's Thousands upon thousands of them. This picture is famous. This was actually taken by.

**[00:41:58]** Not picture, but it's. This is from Purkinje, the guy who sort of like he created. Oh, sorry, Cajal says right there. Ramoni Cajal, who was part of the sort of group that came up with the staining mechanisms that allowed us to sort of start looking at neurons in their isolation. That happened in roughly 1909.

**[00:42:24]** Before that, we didn't really know what neurons were and we didn't know if they were just one big mass or if they were individualized pieces. And there was like a big scientific and philosophical debate about our neuro. Is the brain all one big connected piece or did the p. Like, do the neurons touch or are they separated from each other? And there was Ramon y Cajal who was arguing in the favor of the synapse doctrine, which said that there was a gap between them. And then I think it was Golgi who was arguing in favor of their.

**[00:42:54]** It's all touching, whatever that was called. And then Golgi came up with like a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them to make images like this of looking at cells. And ironically, by making that staining process prove the Cajal side of that argument correct and that they tend not to touch. And then they both got. Both Ramoni Cajal and Golgi got.

**[00:43:22]** They shared a Nobel Prize, but apparently they had such bad blood between them that they both spent their entire speech bashing the other guy. So there you go. You got that.

**[00:43:35]** But yeah. So your do, do, do, do. So your cerebellum consists of purkinje cells, and then granule cell, in comparison, look more like this. They're small and they don't have these super long fibers that sort of go very long distances. They're much more localized.

**[00:44:01]** They only connect to their immediate neighbors. And the majority of neurons in your nervous system are these granule cells that live in your cerebellum. Your cerebellum is a layered thing.

**[00:44:19]** Like most parts of your brain. It's got kind of like, the layers tend to operate phylogenetically, so that on the outside is the newest stuff, on the inside is the older stuff. Cerebellum has that structure. We may talk about it. I'm not sure we'll see.

**[00:44:37]** It's one of those things like, if enough people talk to the bot and ask about this, then I might like. I'll be trying to steer the lectures based off the interest of the class. But anyway, we're talking about cats.

**[00:44:50]** So light, hit the cat, hit your Eye absorbed in your retina, tweaked your opsins, triggered a neural cascade, vibrated your visual cortex, gave you the perception of a cat. Your volitional desire to touch the cat, combined with the knowledge that there's a cat in front of you, and started creating a motor plan, which sort of, you know, this is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because it's like, there's a lot of controversy about like, the different steps of this process. But long story short, something in the combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum, which is your cerebellum, is largely like a motor based thing, like a movement. It mostly deals with movement of your body. It's thought to be related to like tool use.

**[00:45:41]** So this, this thing that we humans can do where we pick up an object and kind of pretty quickly learn the physics of it and using it as a tool that has certain sort of characteristics is thought to be like a neocerebellum thing. The neo is the new part. It's on the outside, it's complicated.

**[00:46:03]** But there's a level, there's a hierarchical nature of your motor system where at the higher levels, where the top is pretty much like the frontal lobe, the plans are much more abstract. So it's things like, I'm thirsty, I wish I was drinking water right now. And then in order for that high level volition to be turned into something that can actually sort of lead me to my goal, there has to be this sort of like paring down of specificity from that very high level volition down to something which at some level is going to have to boil down to muscle firings to move my body through space. And so as I say, oh, I wish I had water, I see that there's water over there. And somehow that volition is converted into motor commands that move my legs.

**[00:46:56]** So now my body is in a place that I can move my arm. I know how this thing works. So I open the thing and I get to drink water.

**[00:47:07]** And so that process tends to go from the motor cortex. Then you got the cerebellum. Then your cerebellum sort of has connections to your brain stem. I say connections, but they're really kind of like they're wrapped around each other. So you have your brain stem, your medulla oblongata, your pons.

**[00:47:32]** That's the part of your brain people talk about, your reptilian brain. That's that part, that's the part that handles things like, is my heart beating? Am I breathing? Is my temperature within a livable range that tends to be hanging out and controlled at your brain stem. Your brain stem is the start of your spinal cord, which is another good friend.

**[00:48:02]** There you go.

**[00:48:06]** There you Perfect.

**[00:48:15]** Nice. Still you. Good job.

**[00:48:21]** And so your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system. Oftentimes, when we think about the spinal cord, it's often kind of it's given a bad rap. And we tend even when we look at pictures of, like, if you Google pictures of the central nervous system, you'll often see pictures that stop here. And it's just sort of like corticocentrism, sort of just focused on that rose on the bush. And then less to say about the cerebellum often gets into the picture.

**[00:48:50]** But we often cut off where the spine is. But your spine is just as much a part of your central nervous system as the rest of it. And specifically, the way that.

---

### Chunk 6 [00:48:45 - 00:58:45]

**[00:48:45]** That rose on the bush. And then less to say about the cerebellum often gets into the picture. But we often cut off where the spine is. But your spine is just as much a part of your central nervous system as the rest of it. And specifically, the way that we're going to define central nervous system, as opposed to peripheral nervous system, is loosely that the central nervous system is where processing happens.

**[00:49:12]** Where processing is a very goopy term that basically means, like, information is coming in, being some sort of conversion is happening, which you might call a computation, if we wanted to use like a computer analogy.

**[00:49:31]** But information comes in, changes form in some way, and then information goes out.

**[00:49:38]** And the spine is doing that kind of processing at various levels, which we will also talk about. Let me see if probably are on time. You're okay on time, but it's in very kind of fascinating ways. And there are some stories that we will talk about later in the semester of studies that we aren't allowed to do anymore on cats, where you can sever the spine, cut the spine, so it no longer connects to the upper part of the brain. And the cat can still do things like walk, because the spine is housing the gray matter that handles things like central pattern generation and.

**[00:50:30]** And reflex responses or something. Like a central pattern generator is a thing that handles the basic rhythmic motion of my legs. And the thing that says, oh, well, one foot is going to be in stance and the other one's going to be in swing. And then they're going to sort of swap off. And a lot of that processing is handled in the spine itself.

**[00:50:53]** Your spine goes down their spinal cord ends actually around here, like right below your thoracic spine. I know, right. And then the stuff below that is what's called like, the caudus aquinas, which is like, that's where it does become more extension cordy, like. And you start to lose the gray matter and you get the more. Just like the peripheral nerves that go out to your limbs.

**[00:51:23]** Yeah. So the peripheral. So I also just want to just again make that point that that distinction between central nervous system and peripheral nervous system is the kind of thing that is often stated as, like, this is a hard delineation, but there's a lot of gray area there. One of the most classic gray areas is the retina. The retina has a lot of neurons on the back of it, and there's layers to it.

**[00:51:49]** And it's often described, like, we think about the retina, the eye, as sort of like the classical sensory organ, but there's stuff happening on the back of the retina before anything even leaves on that optic nerve pass to the brain. That really could be considered to be computation. Similarly, your skin has a lot of connections in it that might be doing things that we might consider computation. That's why when you get hurt, if you rub the thing, it doesn't hurt as much because the activity of activating your sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the feeling coming from the damaged area. And that is all happening at the level of your skin.

**[00:52:36]** So just again, these names and terms and whatnot, this is not like nature is not divided into pieces with departments and names. That's a thing that we humans did to nature so that we could have any hope of making any sense of it. But anytime we put a name or a label or a category into nature, we're always going to be making concessions and sort of we're drawing lines around areas because it allows us to have better conversations about those things. But there's always going to be gray areas. And oftentimes it's those gray areas or the cracks that tend to lead us to abandon certain thoughts and go towards others.

**[00:53:20]** Okay, so speaking of the peripheral nervous system, do, do, do, do. I wish I had.

**[00:53:37]** There you go.

**[00:53:47]** Okay. This is your arm. These are your bones. And your bones are mostly what you are like. If we're thinking about it in terms of the space that you inhabit, like the shape that you are, your general sort of ability to move through the world, it's mostly bones.

**[00:54:07]** And then all the goop that's associated with that is sort of the details. But the general cookie cutter shape of you as a creature is driven by these weird sticks. And these weird sticks have weird things attached to them called muscles.

**[00:54:27]** And.

**[00:54:31]** Yeah, so eventually, one of the things that happens when you thinking about the sort of, like, more holistic picture of the world and sort of way that you live in it is if you're in a lab, if you're living this reductionist life where you're choosing a particular domain of inquiry and you're sort of simplifying and cutting out any extraneous factors that get in your way just to sort of zoom in as far as you can on that particular thing, you get to remove all the parts of the question that you don't want to look at. And so if you're a neuroscientist, you might take the mouse or the rat or the fruit fly or whoever you want to look at into the lab and then just like, remove all the parts that Aren't neuroscience so that you can have a better picture of the neurons that you care about? When you want to think about, when you don't have that capacity and you want to think about things more generally, you don't have that luxury. And so if you want to think about how humans move through the world, and even if you care mostly about the neural aspects of it, even if you care mostly about the perceptual aspects of that, you are sort of required by the nature of reality to consider things like bones and muscles, even though those are not particularly neural objects. Because when we move, when all this weird neural flammery is eventually going to have to transmit down into something that moves the body through the world.

**[00:56:07]** And this is where we get to the kind of the roboticsy conversation. Because this is the part where the neural activity which has been originally transduced into the sensory experience of, of vision, all of that sort of combination of things is eventually going to get boiled down here to something that sort of flips that coin around. And now the neural activity is going to be converted into environmental energy, in this case in the form of mechanical energy. So it's going to squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to move, squeeze that muscle, my arm is going to be moved. And this is now has there's literal energy in this movement, specifically in the form of kinetic energy.

**[00:56:55]** Or if I'm pulling on a spring or something like that might be mechanical energy, like potential energy, kinetic energy, spring energy. That's the stuff that we get from our muscles. And so that's the whole perception action cycle is this conversion of environmental energy into perceptual neural activity down back into a motor action. So your muscles are weird objects. And a muscle is effectively a variable stiffness spring.

**[00:57:29]** That's pretty much what a muscle is. Muscles only pull. Your muscle can only pull on things muscles cannot push. When it looks like I'm pushing, it's because this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so that my arm goes that way and that's called extension. And then if I want to squeeze this one, then I send a motor command down there.

**[00:57:53]** It fires the motor tendon union Golgi body organs. And it says, hey, surrounding muscle tissue contract. This, what was originally a fairly wiggly soft spring gets electrified and becomes a rather stiff spring and pulls this joint up. In this one, they're paired. There's a flexion muscle group and then there's the extension muscle group.

**[00:58:22]** And those two things operate in conjunction to move this degree of freedom and that type of. So, yeah, and so that.

**[00:58:38]** So the motor plan that comes down from the motor cortex and sort of through the cerebellum, if you're a.

---

### Chunk 7 [00:58:30 - 01:08:30]

**[00:58:30]** That type of. So, yeah, and so that.

**[00:58:38]** So the motor plan that comes down from the motor cortex and sort of through the cerebellum, if you're a fancy type of an animal, like a human, it goes through the corticospinal tract, which goes. There is a sort of connection straight from your motor cortex down to your spine, bypassing things like your cerebellum. All animals have a corticospinal tract, but it's really. But not to equal degree. And that's one of the interesting distinctions in the animal kingdom is like, this is one of my favorite.

**[00:59:09]** I actually use this question to test AI models to see how it does at. Neuroscience is asking about the corticospinal tract and how it varies across the animal kingdom, because that's one of the places where the questions get really subtle. And so I can look at how it does at that answer to see, like, I'm looking at, like, a local model I can run on my computer. Like, the small ones. I can watch it get the subtle parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a question.

**[00:59:38]** But a lot of stuff I've been talking about how, like, motor cortex, motor commands go through, like, the cerebellum and the brainstem and stuff like that. That is true, but there is also this corticospinal tract. Anytime you see one of those big words with an O in the middle, just replace the O with a slash. So corticospinal is corticortex spinal that just basically goes straight from the cortex down to the spine, bypassing all the subcortical regions.

**[01:00:08]** And it's what allows us to control our individual degrees of freedom, our body directly, as opposed to doing things in, like, more synergistic way, which is way deeper than I want to talk about in this particular lecture. Checking that clock, it's killing me. So, yeah, so here I am. I'm so close. I'm so ready to almost touch this cat.

**[01:00:34]** And my motor plan, which has come down from on high down. This sort of hierarchical structure of our motor system has taken my awareness of the world and my own body. So the vision gives me information about remote parts of the world, things I cannot touch, things that are outside of my. Here's a great word, peripersonal space. The peripersonal space is the area that I can touch with my hands.

**[01:01:06]** Outside of that is a different part of the world that's kind of happening in the parietal lobe. One of my favorite studies is this, like, they got a monkey macaque Monkey. And they trained it to grab things on a desk, and then they gave it a temporary lesion. So they just like squirt something into the part of the brain that handles that peripersonal perception. So the.

**[01:01:33]** That. That part of the brain kind of goes offline and you get what's called cortical blindness. So the monkey sort of loses its ability to see things cartoon, cartoon in that peripersonal zone. Then they took the monkeys and they train it to use a grabber arm, like a little claw arm. So now its reach is now farther because it can use this arm.

**[01:01:55]** And after they teach it how to use it and they sort of lesion that peripersonal zone, the blind spot increases to include the region that could be reached with the grabber in addition to the hand. So put that into your worldview and see how it fits.

**[01:02:16]** So anyways, here I am, I see this cat and I have this awareness of my body. A lot of this is sort of called. We kind of associate that with proprioception. So, like, as my arm is out here, it is putting force on my joints because of the weight of the arm. And my body can encode and is aware of those forces.

**[01:02:41]** And I can use that to kind of be aware of where my arm is. I can also see my arm. I also have a memory of lifting it up. There's a lot of ways that we know where our bodies are, but I know that it's here and that if I can make this part move that way, then I will have achieved my deepest desire of touching this cat.

**[01:03:04]** And so there's a lot of complicated stuff about, like, we don't move our body one joint at a time. We move it in this sort of like really sophisticated dance. And a lot of that, the breakdown and how we sort of how we choose to break down a complex movement across the available joints in the context of the world. That's a cerebellum thing. Again, cartoons.

**[01:03:32]** But let's pretend like it's not. And so I relax. What is it? So I relax the flexor, I tighten the extensor. And that puts a torque on this bone which moves my hand here.

**[01:03:50]** And now I have the reward of cat sensations under my hand. And I have now achieved this goal of mine, right? And so now. And now we have. And that's the loop.

**[01:04:10]** So that's one pass through that perception action loop. Because now that the information has gone in, been processed, been sort of whatever. And now that I have moved my body, I have now changed the state of the world, My body's in the world. So now as I'm perceiving the situation as it stands, I'm perceiving something different. And now I'm going to go back through that loop and sort of, you know, you perceive, you act and then you take in the information.

**[01:04:36]** You kind of like that loop tends to be where you live your whole life.

**[01:04:43]** And so, yeah, so this is kind of the cartoon overview of the story as it holds. I will name some of the fields associated with the things that we talked about.

**[01:05:01]** Yeah, generally speaking, when we talk about, well, talking about like the physiology of the eyeball tends to be kind of like ophthalmology, I guess, but that's more like lens and pupil and like the goopy parts. Once you're talking about like the neuro, the neural activity aspect of it, we tend to call that like visual, like visual neuroscience, perceptual neuroscience because we are such vision heavy animals as humans. Often when you hear perceptual we tend to mean visual. But strictly speaking, it's all like anything sensory is perceptual. We start talking about the parts of the neuroscience that are moving your body.

**[01:05:47]** We tend to call that motor neuroscience. You will often hear people talk about perceptual motor neuroscience, which again, perceptuomotor is the same as perceptual slash motor. And it's kind of like it's this connection and it's kind of like this reality that the two parts are perception and action and perception and motor control. They're sort of intimately linked.

**[01:06:10]** Oh, I should mention this too. In your peripheral nervous system, you have peripheral neurons and your peripheral neurons come in two types of, there is perceptual and there's motor, shockingly. And that distinction is defined by basically which direction the information is flowing. So a motor command goes out from your central nervous system towards your periphery carrying a motor command. So this is a neuron that's connected to a motor unit in my muscle.

**[01:06:48]** And if it gets sort of tapped by one of these higher level structures, it's going to get spikes that are telling it to fire and that will contract the muscle Once I touch the cat, what was the object of my plans? There are the neurons connected to the sensory organs in my hand start firing differently and they send information back down your sensory peripheral nerves. Peripheral sensory nerves, yeah. So in your periphery it is just, it's out. Outward stuff is your motor neurons, inward stuff is your sensory neurons.

**[01:07:36]** And that's kind of the main distinction there. Again, what's the word cartoons going on there. Yeah.

**[01:07:47]** What's that?

**[01:07:52]** Why are you not aware?

**[01:07:56]** This is one of, I think, the most troubling realities of being alive is that. And this is also part of the standard existential crisis that classes like this tends to give to people. So have fun with that. We have a very, very thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies. And we have.

**[01:08:26]** We have some awareness, we have some conscious experience of like, I'm going to reach out and.

---

### Chunk 8 [01:08:15 - 01:18:15]

**[01:08:15]** We have a very, very thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies. And we have some awareness, we have some conscious experience of like, I'm gonna reach out and grab this thing. I'm gonna. Oh, yeah, this feels cool in my hand. This feels hard in my hand.

**[01:08:36]** But the more you learn about neuroscience and the more you learn about what's going on under the hood, the more you realize that those set sensory, that, like the cognitive, like the conscious, personal experience of having a motor experience is a really, really thin layer on top of a lot of complexity that's going on. And that is unfortunately, just like the situation that we are in. I remember one time I was in grad school and we were in, like, a parking lot, my friends, in winter, waiting to go on a hike or something like that. And for some reason, this really stuck with me, but there was just, like, a puddle of, like, dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that had this, like, really beautiful, like, oil sheen on top of it. And it was just like the sort of fractal, iridescent colors just.

**[01:09:31]** And by the nature of oil, it's just like one molecule thick that is giving this really beautiful, like, vibrant, colorful shape on top of just cold, dark, murky water. And I think about that a lot when I think about the nervous system, because it just feels like that is kind of our experience of living in a body as we have this conscious experience that is sort of riding on top of this really deep and complex biological, neural, complex system. And that conscious sheen is related to the depths of what's going on there. But we don't really tend to have access to it. Like, I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes to digest my food.

**[01:10:22]** And I can't tell the difference between, you know, parts of this thing happening. And, you know, it's not really available to me. Once you start learning about the bits and pieces, you can start kind of mapping on your conscious experiences to the things that I'm going to be telling you is maybe happening under the hood. One of the ones that's coming to me right now, for whatever reason, is it's kind of a thing that is known where when a person starts lifting weights for the first time, if they've never been a weightlifting person, there's a thing that happens where you very quickly, like, you'll shoot up the amount of weight that you can lift in a very short amount of time because your body is learning how to fire all of your motor units at once. And that's just a thing that in your general life you just tend not to do.

**[01:11:14]** You kind of have to learn how to do that, like, how to extend, like, maximal effort. And that is something that's happening at the level of, like, recruitment of motor units. And so if you now go to the gym and you start having that experience, you sort of feel, oh, yeah, I'm getting super strong. And it's just kind of like you can map that experience onto this thing I just said about how your motor units work. But that mapping is in this, like, weird cognitive space.

**[01:11:39]** Like, it's not that level of, like, deep awareness. But then you have to ask, like, what would that even look like if it was? Yeah. So over time, when you're like lifting weights, why do you hit like a plateau? Because eventually you're recruiting all of your motor units and then you just don't have enough muscle to produce the force.

**[01:11:58]** So that's that beginner spike in performance is you're not actually growing muscle mass in that period of time. You're just learning how to actually, like, use all the muscles that you have. And then you hit that plateau and it's like, okay, well, Now I'm firing 100% of my muscle abilities. Just my muscles aren't strong enough to actually move my body. And a lot of those sort of plateaus in performance can be sort of tied back to sort of physiological structures that change.

**[01:12:25]** And like, the time courses of improvement happen that, you know, like, growing more muscle takes time, whereas learning how to fire motor units also takes time, but not in the same way. So a lot of death there.

**[01:12:43]** That area that I was just so speaking of naming and never. I've never been able to finish a lecture before the end of class.

**[01:12:54]** That thing, if it were just that little area, is kind of often in the area we would call neuromechanics. Neuromechanics is a relatively new, newly named field. I would be curious to see if it's in that mesh terminology thing we learned about last time. But neuromechanics, neural mechanics is kind of like at that boundary of neural activity and physics mechanics stuff. So that thing of firing a motor unit to create a spring force that moves the limb, that's a neural mechanical question.

**[01:13:34]** And then how that connects to the spinal central pattern generators, you know, that's where it starts to get like, is that still neuromechanics is that, you know, these are murky areas.

**[01:13:45]** On the other side of neuromechanics, you have biomechanics Biomechanics is literally Newton's laws as it applies to meat. And we will be talking about that to some level of specificity. The not too distant future.

**[01:14:07]** Let's see if.

**[01:14:12]** Yeah, let me finish this up and we'll talk about that.

**[01:14:18]** Yeah, so biomechanics is related to like just the physics of moving your body. We're particularly going to talk about descriptions of the body that basically remove any conception of biology from them. And just thinking about the human as an object that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow platform and that sort of center of mass, base of support, level of description of the human body, which we will talk about in some detail pretty soon. Another thing I haven't mentioned, but we will talk about too, is evolution, because all of these systems are evolved systems. They were developed over billions of years to the form that they currently are.

**[01:15:07]** And in the same sense of things, you can describe the system as it stands right now, but you're always going to be missing some of the story if you don't think about it in the context of how it emerged. And so I haven't quite figured out.

**[01:15:23]** A lot of the things I'm talking about are the things that are going to go into these sort of numbered lectures. Once I sort of figure out how I want to chop things up. I'm going to be extracting a lot of things from what your conversations are to figure out how to steer those lectures. There are some hit points that I'm going to hit no matter what you guys want to do. And evolution is going to be one of those things.

**[01:15:46]** And specifically for us, I'm going to be. Well, I guess talk a little about the evolution of your eye. But I think a lot of my particular interest is in the thing that is often, yeah, evolution of your skeleton. Like why our skeletons are the particular weird shape that they are. How we sort of developed from our origins as fish that turn into lizards that turn into squirrels that turn into monkeys that turn into apes that turn into us, because it matters a lot.

**[01:16:26]** Evolution of our eye is another odd story.

**[01:16:32]** Our retina is backwards in some pretty interesting ways. It's flipped in the direction that you would expect it to be. Like you would expect that the light sensing aspects of it would be facing towards the light, but they're actually backwards. They face back and they kind of have to bounce through. And this is thought to be related to like when we crawled out of the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen yeah.

**[01:17:04]** So we didn't talk in this particular story about eye movements. Eye movements we will talk about also in some detail.

**[01:17:13]** We humans have very mobile eyes. That's a very cornerstone aspect of our visual system, is that our eyes move a lot. It is part of the motor system to be able to move any part of your body, including the eyes. And that specific area is called oculomotor control. Oculo.

**[01:17:31]** Eye motor movement. Oculomotor is sort of stuff related to eye movements.

**[01:17:39]** And so things like oculomotor control, obviously very overlapping with things like visual perception and perceptual neuroscience, because as we move our eyes, the information on the retina changes, and we have to make. And we make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way we make decisions about where to move our arms. But this is also a place that, like, as, like, we. You can live a whole happy life and, like, never really think about your eye movements. But once you start thinking about your eye movements, you'll realize that it's.

**[01:18:12]** I think about it a lot. Like, it's. It feels like.

### Chunk 9 [01:18:00 - 01:28:37]

**[01:18:00]** That like, as like we. You can live a whole happy life and like never really think about your eye movements. But once you start thinking about your eye movements, you'll realize that it's. I think about it a lot. Like it feels a lot like breathing to me.

**[01:18:16]** Where usually your breathing is something that just happens on its own, but you can control it to some extent. Like I can hold my breath, I can take a breath, I can do that. I have volitional control over my breathing in a way that I don't over my heart. And our eye movements are kind of like that as well. Like I can choose to look one place or another, I can choose not to look at something.

**[01:18:43]** But for the most part, for 99.9% of my waking life, my eyes are just kind of doing what they do and being driven by a combination of available visual information and my desires of the world. And sometimes like if I throw something in the air, I will look at it and then catch it. And there's a lot of that process that is happening just below that level of conscious awareness. And that I think is a nice enough segue into what we're going to talk about for the last 10 minutes, which is methods, methodologies. Methods is kind of a.

**[01:19:24]** It's just a term that we use for like how in God's name are you going to study any of this? That's kind of what methods means. And generally speaking, when we talk about methods, we're talking about equipment and ways that we can do empirical measurements of the world that will give us information that. About parts of the world that we think might. We might be able to glean some insight into these deeper, weirder aspects of the.

**[01:19:54]** This is another great term, desiderata of our investigation. Desiderata means that which is desired. And it is a sort of philosophy of science term about what are you trying to figure out. You came into this room as a scientist because you have a certain. There's something you want to know more about.

**[01:20:14]** There's some part of the world that you want to gain insight into. What is that thing and how can you do it, given all the limitations and constraints and difficulties of how the world is.

**[01:20:31]** For me, in my domain of inquiry, I use two primary research tools. Mocap, which is short for motion capture, which is the thing if you see like behind the scenes stuff in movies and video games, like the suit with the dots and stuff like that, that's motion capture. And that's basically related to moving the body, like sort of recording the movement of the body. In space. And I will be at one of the lab sections.

**[01:21:02]** I will be showing, be bringing in some cameras and doing Freemo Cap recording, which is the open source software that I've been building, which is designed to help record the body with a high degree of fidelity. Like the specific three dimensional configuration of the body at any given moment in time. Because I would love to be able to study all the spiking activity of the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, but that's not available to me in this year of our lower 2025. I can't actually get that measurement and the methods that I could use, even if we could get that from something like fmri, which is like the tube that you get the sort of colorful pictures of the brain in this current moment in technology, I can't use that type of a tool and also have a person out in the world throwing and catching and doing stuff like that.

**[01:21:56]** We use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration of the body over time. And then we use those movements to try to infer, well, if the arm did this and gravity is like that, then the muscles must have done this or that in order to produce the forces that generated that movement. And then you kind of backtrack from, well, if the muscles did this, then the spine must have done that. And sort of you can use this kind of like this observable aspect of reality, which is like the location of the arm, measure it to the level of fidelity that you can with the available technology that you have, and then use those empirical measurements to try to infer all this weird goopy nonsense of what I've been talking about, about this part of the brain. That part of the brain, that part of the brain.

**[01:22:46]** The other technology that I tend to use a lot and is I can draw on this board eye tracking, which everybody loves, eye tracking, it's always a crowd favorite, but that's another sort of like there's different tools to use it. But mostly these days we use video based eye trackers, which is literally just little cameras pointed at the eye. And it's kind of a convenient thing that we are, as humans have these highly mobile eyes that sort of wind up giving this really interesting readout of what my brain wanted to get more information about at each moment in time. So if you give me a task like walking over rough terrain or sort of juggling or throwing and catching or something like that, you can look at the movement of my eye and at the very least know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing sort of 3D modeling and sort of saying, okay, the eye moved this way and then the object was over here. And so, you know, based on what I know about the eye, I couldn't see it then, or I could see it in my periphery.

**[01:24:01]** And then I chose to make a movement that would align my eye so now it's in my fovea. And so you can use just like a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information that was being transmitted into my visual cortex and sort of going down that way, which both gives you the information that I had available. And more importantly, arguably, the place that my eyes move to tells me the place that my central nervous system decided I want more information from this part of the world. And because those eye movements tend to happen really, really fast, like 150 milliseconds per eye movement, if you're doing a difficult task, like well below the level of conscious awareness, we can tell stories about what we were doing after the fact. But in the moment, the eyes just kind of go where they need to go.

**[01:24:51]** And so I can tell both what information was available to this weird magical meat robot at any moment in time. And I can also look at the decisions that were made of, oh, I'm going to move my eyes this way and not that way until where my central nervous system desired more information from in the world at any moment in time. And so by the combination of these things of being able to measure the sort of perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and the motor output in the form of motion capture, we I this is my general attempt, my general approach to scientific research is to try to combine these two methodologies to give a sense of, like, get a picture of what's happened, of what a given, of what a human is doing in the world, as they sort of perform complex actions and then use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to get some insight into this stuff. Often in my particular case, in the sort of conversation of science, this domain, this type of research tends to give ecologically valid. It's real data of real people doing real stuff, but the fidelity is just limited.

**[01:26:09]** There's only the accuracy and precision of information that I can provide with these methods is just very, very limited. But relative to someone who's in a lab pulling out individual neurons and sort of doing all the reductionist work that they can do to get really precise numbers. So the sociology of science is people like me doing the broad stroke type of Research work with people who do the more careful reductionist stuff. And ideally, we kind of. We both work together so that we can tell more complete stories and tell more satisfying cartoon stories of what's going on for humans to.

**[01:26:43]** To new generations of undergrads every year or two. Okay. Get all that covered. No more questions. Neuroscience.

**[01:26:56]** Nailed it. Great. Cool. Well, that's it. Is there any.

**[01:27:03]** We do have, like, three more minutes. Does anyone have any questions or. What's the word? Emotional outbursts, Central crises. Things I wish I said more about.

**[01:27:14]** No one would say anything in this moment in class. I appreciate. Oh, you do?

**[01:27:24]** Yeah, yeah. Opsins. Opsins. That's the term. O P. S I N. It reminded me of, like, photos and.

**[01:27:33]** Yeah, yeah, it's the same. I mean, plants don't really have the motor aspect, but. Yeah, that's for the biochemistry people. I think it's. The opsins is the part that has.

**[01:27:43]** The. More. There's a lot of depth there. There's only. It's like a class of chemical and so you can.

**[01:27:52]** You can look at that. Okay, great. Thank you for showing up. Keep an eye on the Discord server. Discord server and canvas.

**[01:28:02]** I'll make an announcement about the actual assignments going on and. Yeah. See you on Monday. What's that? So no assignment for this Sunday?

**[01:28:12]** No, not this Sunday. And then I guess Monday is a holiday, so I'll see you in a week. Someone here told me that. Was it you? Somebody told me.

**[01:28:22]** Someone told me that there was a holiday. Yeah. Thank you. Appreciate that. I probably would have figured it out.

**[01:28:30]** I didn't have either one of them. Yeah, I think it was just those two. Yeah, exactly. Okay.
