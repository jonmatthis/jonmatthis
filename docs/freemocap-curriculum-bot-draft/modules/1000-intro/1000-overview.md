## What is Motion Capture?

Motion capture (mocap) is a technology for recording movement and translating it into digital data. It has applications across many fields including:

- Scientific research (biomechanics, neuroscience, sports science)
- 3D animation and film
- Video game development
- Clinical assessment and rehabilitation
- Performance analysis

## What is FreeMoCap?

FreeMoCap (Free Motion Capture) is a free, open-source markerless motion capture system designed to provide research-quality motion capture data using generic, minimal-cost webcams.
