# 1002 - Calibration

```{note}
This module introduces camera calibration, a critical step for multi-camera motion capture.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why calibration is necessary for 3D motion capture
- Learn to record calibration footage using a ChArUco board
- Successfully complete a calibration procedure

## What is Calibration?

Calibration is the process of determining camera parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic) so that 2D points from multiple cameras can be triangulated into 3D coordinates.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [1001 - Baby's First Skeleton](./1001-single-camera.md)
- A printed ChArUco calibration board
- Multiple cameras set up (minimum 2, recommended 3+)

## Deliverable

**Calibration recording folder (zip file)**

Your deliverable should include:
- The complete calibration recording session folder
- Evidence of successful calibration

```{tip}
Ensure the ChArUco board is visible from multiple camera angles throughout your calibration recording.
```

## Next Steps

After completing this module, proceed to [1003 - Multi-Camera Recording](./1003-multi-camera.md).
