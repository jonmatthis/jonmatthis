## Deliverable

**Single camera recording folder (zip file)**

Your deliverable should include:

- Verification that a person is detectable in the footage
- Confirmation that tracking is reasonably smooth (for desk or full-body setup as chosen)

```{tip}
Compress your recording folder into a zip file before submission.
```

## Quality Checks

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Person is visible and detectable throughout the recording
- [ ] Tracking overlay shows skeleton points on the subject
- [ ] Movement tracking appears reasonably smooth without excessive jitter

## Next Steps
