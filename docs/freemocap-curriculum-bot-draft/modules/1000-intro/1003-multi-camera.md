# 1003 - Multi-Camera Recording and Processing

```{note}
This module covers recording and processing with multiple synchronized cameras to produce 3D motion capture data.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Configure and synchronize multiple cameras
- Record multi-camera motion capture footage
- Process recordings through the FreeMoCap pipeline
- Generate 3D skeletal data from multiple camera views

## Prerequisites

- Completed [1002 - Calibration](./1002-calibration.md)
- Multiple cameras set up and calibrated
- Successful calibration file from previous module

## Deliverable

**Recording folder (zip file)**

Your deliverable should include:
- The complete multi-camera recording session folder
- Processed 3D output data

```{tip}
Ensure all cameras have overlapping views of the capture volume and that the subject remains visible to at least 2 cameras at all times.
```

## Next Steps

After completing this module, proceed to [1004 - Exploring Data Output](./1004-data-output.md).
