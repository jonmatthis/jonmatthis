# 1004 - Exploring Data Output and Blender Visualization

```{note}
This module covers understanding FreeMoCap's data outputs and visualizing motion capture data in Blender.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of FreeMoCap output data
- Navigate the output folder and file formats
- Load and visualize motion capture data in Blender
- Create a polished Blender scene with your captured motion

## FreeMoCap Output Data

FreeMoCap produces several types of output data:
- NumPy arrays (.npy files)
- CSV files (tall and wide formats)
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- Blender scene files

## Prerequisites

- Completed [1003 - Multi-Camera Recording](./1003-multi-camera.md)
- Blender installed (free from blender.org)
- Processed recording with 3D data

## Deliverable

**Polished Blender file (.blend)**

Your deliverable should include:
- A Blender scene with your motion capture data loaded
- Basic scene setup and visualization
