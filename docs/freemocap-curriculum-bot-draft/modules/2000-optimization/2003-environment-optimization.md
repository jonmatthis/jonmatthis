# 2003 - Mocap Environment Optimization

```{note}
This module covers optimizing your physical recording environment for the best motion capture results.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Optimize lighting conditions for motion capture
- Select and prepare appropriate backgrounds
- Configure camera placement for optimal coverage
- Prepare subjects for recording (clothing, markers, etc.)

## Topics Covered

- Lighting setup and control
- Background selection and contrast
- Camera angle and placement optimization
- Subject preparation guidelines
- Capture volume planning
- Common environmental issues and solutions

## Prerequisites

- Completed [2002 - Calibration Theory and Practice](./2002-calibration-theory.md)

## Deliverable

**Multiple deliverables:**

1. **Quiz** - Demonstrate understanding of environment optimization principles
2. **Bot chat** - Interactive discussion of optimization strategies
3. **Data output** - Recording that meets stringent quality standards, demonstrating optimized environment setup

## Quality Standards

Your recording should demonstrate:
- Consistent lighting without harsh shadows
- Clean background with good subject contrast
- Minimal occlusions throughout the capture
- Smooth tracking with minimal dropouts

## Next Steps

Continue to [2004 - Data Output Details](./2004-data-output-details.md).
