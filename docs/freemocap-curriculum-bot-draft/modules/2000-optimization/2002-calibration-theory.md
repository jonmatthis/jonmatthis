# 2002 - Calibration Theory and Practice

```{note}
This module dives deeper into calibration theory and advanced calibration practices for improved accuracy.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters
- Learn about lens distortion models
- Master calibration board handling techniques
- Achieve more stringent calibration quality standards

## Topics Covered

- Camera matrices and projection
- Intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion)
- Extrinsic parameters (rotation, translation)
- ChArUco board fundamentals
- Reprojection error analysis
- Anipose-based calibration details

## Prerequisites

- Completed [2001 - Mocap Technicals Overview](./2001-mocap-technicals.md)
- Previous calibration experience from 1000-level

## Deliverable

**Same as 1002, with more stringent standards**

Your deliverable should demonstrate improved calibration quality:
- Lower reprojection error
- Better coverage of the capture volume
- Evidence of understanding calibration concepts

**Additional:** Bot chat interaction demonstrating understanding of calibration theory.

## Quality Standards

For this module, aim for:
- Reprojection error significantly lower than beginner-level captures
- Full coverage of intended capture volume
- Consistent calibration results across attempts

## Next Steps

Continue to [2003 - Mocap Environment Optimization](./2003-environment-optimization.md).
