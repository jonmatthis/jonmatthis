# 2001 - Mocap Technicals Overview

```{note}
This module provides a deeper technical understanding of how markerless motion capture systems work.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the technical pipeline of markerless motion capture
- Learn about pose estimation algorithms and their limitations
- Understand triangulation and 3D reconstruction
- Identify sources of error in the capture process

## Topics Covered

- Camera fundamentals (resolution, frame rate, exposure)
- Pose estimation models (MediaPipe, YOLO)
- Multi-view geometry basics
- Triangulation principles
- Error sources and mitigation

## Prerequisites

- Completed [2000 - Overview](./2000-overview.md)

## Deliverable

**Bot chat interaction**

Demonstrate your understanding through a conversation with the course bot covering key technical concepts.

## Next Steps

Continue to [2002 - Calibration Theory and Practice](./2002-calibration-theory.md).
