# 3324 - Real-Time Applications

```{note}
This module covers real-time motion capture applications including VTubing and live performance.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand real-time mocap requirements
- Set up live character animation
- Explore VTubing and streaming applications
- Create interactive performance systems

## Topics Covered

- Real-time mocap pipeline considerations
- Latency optimization
- VTubing basics
- OBS integration for streaming
- Live performance setups
- Audience interaction possibilities
- Multi-person real-time capture
- Face and hand tracking for VTubing

## Applications

- **VTubing**: Stream as an animated character
- **Live Performance**: Dance, theater, interactive art
- **Presentations**: Animated avatar presentations
- **Interactive Installations**: Responsive character displays

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3323 - Unreal & Unity Integration](./3323-unreal-unity.md)

## Deliverable

**Real-time character demo**

Create a real-time animated character setup:
- Live mocap input (can use recorded video processed in real-time)
- Character responds to movement
- Documentation of setup and latency

**Bot chat** discussing real-time application possibilities.
