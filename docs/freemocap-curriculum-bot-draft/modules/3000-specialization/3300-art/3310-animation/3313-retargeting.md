- Handle proportion differences between source and target
- Use Blender tools and addons for retargeting

## Topics Covered

- Retargeting fundamentals
- Bone mapping strategies
- Handling different bone counts
- Proportion adjustment techniques
- Constraint-based retargeting
- Blender retargeting addons
- Preserving ground contact
- Retargeting to non-humanoid characters

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3312 - Character Rigging](./3312-character-rigging.md)

## Deliverable

**Retargeted animation**

Transfer FreeMoCap motion to a custom character:
