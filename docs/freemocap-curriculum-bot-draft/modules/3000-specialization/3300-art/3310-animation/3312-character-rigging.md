- Create rigs compatible with motion capture
- Use Blender's Rigify auto-rigging system
- Prepare rigs for retargeting

## Topics Covered

- Armature structure for animation
- Bone naming conventions
- Weight painting basics
- Rigify auto-rigging in Blender
- Control bones vs deform bones
- IK vs FK considerations for mocap
- T-pose and rest pose setup
- Rig testing and validation

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3311 - Mocap Cleanup & Polish](./3311-mocap-cleanup.md)

## Deliverable

**Rigged character**

Create or modify a character rig suitable for mocap:
- Proper bone hierarchy
- T-pose ready
- Weight painted mesh
- Documentation of rig structure

**Bot chat** discussing rigging decisions for mocap compatibility.
