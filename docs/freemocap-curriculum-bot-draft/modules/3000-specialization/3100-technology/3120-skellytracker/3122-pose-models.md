# 3122 - Pose Estimation Models

```{note}
This module covers the pose estimation models available in SkellyTracker and their characteristics.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different pose estimation approaches
- Compare MediaPipe, YOLO, and other backends
- Learn about model selection tradeoffs
- Configure models for different use cases

## Topics Covered

- MediaPipe Holistic (pose, hands, face)
- YOLO v11 pose estimation
- Model accuracy vs speed tradeoffs
- GPU vs CPU inference
- Model configuration options
- Landmark definitions and body models
- Multi-person vs single-person tracking

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3121 - Tracker Abstraction Pattern](./3121-tracker-abstraction.md)

## Deliverable

**Model comparison report**

Run multiple trackers on the same video and compare:
- Processing speed (FPS)
- Tracking quality and stability
- Landmark completeness
- Resource usage

**Bot chat** discussing model selection for different scenarios.
