# 3111 - Camera Hardware & Detection

```{note}
This module covers camera hardware interfaces, detection, and configuration in SkellyCam.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how SkellyCam detects and enumerates cameras
- Learn about USB camera interfaces and bandwidth considerations
- Configure camera parameters (resolution, framerate, exposure)
- Troubleshoot common camera hardware issues

## Topics Covered

- Camera detection via OpenCV and platform-specific APIs
- USB bandwidth and hub considerations
- Camera parameter configuration
- Resolution and framerate tradeoffs
- Exposure settings for motion capture
- Multi-camera hardware setup best practices

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3110 - SkellyCam Overview](./3110-skellycam-overview.md)

## Deliverable

**Camera configuration report**

Document your camera setup including detection output, configured parameters, and any troubleshooting performed.

**Bot chat** demonstrating understanding of camera hardware concepts.
