# 3112 - Video Synchronization

```{note}
This module covers frame synchronization across multiple cameras.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why synchronization is critical for 3D reconstruction
- Learn about timestamp generation and frame alignment
- Analyze synchronization quality from timestamp data
- Troubleshoot synchronization issues

## Topics Covered

- Software vs hardware synchronization approaches
- Timestamp generation in SkellyCam
- Frame alignment algorithms
- Measuring synchronization quality
- Audio-based synchronization (skelly_synchronize)
- Dealing with dropped frames and timing drift

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3111 - Camera Hardware & Detection](./3111-camera-hardware.md)

## Deliverable

**Timestamp analysis report**

Generate and analyze timestamps from a multi-camera recording:
- Calculate inter-camera timing differences
- Identify any synchronization issues
- Document synchronization quality metrics

**Bot chat** demonstrating understanding of synchronization concepts.
