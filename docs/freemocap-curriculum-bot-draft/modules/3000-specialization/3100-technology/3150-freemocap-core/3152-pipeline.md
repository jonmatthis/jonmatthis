- Handle pipeline errors and recovery

## Topics Covered

- Pipeline stages (recording, calibration, tracking, triangulation, etc.)
- Stage dependencies and ordering
- Worker thread management
- Progress reporting
- Error handling and recovery
- Pipeline configuration
- Headless/CLI pipeline execution

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3151 - GUI Architecture](./3151-gui-architecture.md)

## Deliverable
