# 3220 - Neuroscience: Overview (Perceptuo-motor Control)

```{note}
This sub-specialization focuses on the neural control of movement and perceptuo-motor processes.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the neural basis of movement control
- Learn about perceptuo-motor processes
- Connect motion capture data to neuroscience concepts

## Focus Areas

- Perceptuo-motor control
- Neural control of human movement
- Sensory-motor integration
- Movement planning and execution

## Neuroscience Modules

| Module | Title |
|--------|-------|
| 3221 | Sensory-motor Hierarchy and the Perception Action Cycle |

```{note}
**Future Development:** Additional modules planned for eye tracking, gait analysis from a neuroscience perspective, and other specialized topics.
```

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3202 - Intro to Data Analysis](../3202-data-analysis.md)
- Interest in neuroscience and neural control of movement

## Deliverable

*Overview module - proceed to specific modules for deliverables*

## Next Steps

Begin with [3221 - Sensory-motor Hierarchy](./3221-sensory-motor.md).
