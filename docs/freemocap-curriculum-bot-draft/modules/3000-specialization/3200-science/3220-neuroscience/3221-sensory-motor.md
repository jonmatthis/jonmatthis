# 3221 - Sensory-motor Hierarchy and the Perception Action Cycle

```{note}
This module introduces the sensory-motor hierarchy and the perception-action cycle framework for understanding human movement.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the sensory-motor hierarchy
- Learn about the perception-action cycle (Warren, 2006)
- Connect theoretical frameworks to motion capture analysis

## Key Concepts

- Sensory-motor hierarchy
- Perception-action coupling
- Information-based control of movement
- Affordances and action

## Key Reading

Warren, W. H. (2006). The dynamics of perception and action. *Psychological Review*, 113(2), 358-389.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3220 - Neuroscience Overview](./3220-neuroscience-overview.md)

## Deliverable

*To be specified by instructor*

```{note}
**Future Development:** Additional neuroscience modules are planned, including topics such as eye tracking sub-path, gait analysis sub-path, and other specialized topics.
