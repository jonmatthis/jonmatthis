# 3215 - Gait Data

```{note}
This module involves recording and analyzing walking (gait) movements.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Record motion capture data of walking/gait
- Analyze gait biomechanics
- Extract gait parameters from motion capture data

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3214 - Jumping Data](./3214-jumping-data.md)
- Working motion capture setup

## Deliverable

**Recording of similar movement on yourself**

Record and submit motion capture data of yourself walking (gait analysis).

## 🎉 Biomechanics Sub-Specialization Complete!

Congratulations on completing the Biomechanics sub-specialization! You now have practical experience analyzing different types of human movement using motion capture.

Consider exploring the Neuroscience sub-specialization or other tracks.
