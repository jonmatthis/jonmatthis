# 3214 - Jumping Data

```{note}
This module involves recording and analyzing jumping movements.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Record motion capture data of jumping movements
- Analyze jump biomechanics
- Extract relevant metrics from jumping data

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3213 - BOS/COM Data](./3213-bos-com-data.md)
- Working motion capture setup

## Deliverable

**Recording of similar movement on yourself**

Record and submit motion capture data of yourself performing jumping tasks (e.g., countermovement jumps, standing jumps).

## Next Steps

Continue to [3215 - Gait Data](./3215-gait-data.md).
