# 3212 - Posture, COM, and Base of Support

```{note}
This module covers postural analysis, center of mass dynamics, and base of support concepts.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand postural control and stability
- Analyze center of mass in relation to base of support
- Calculate and visualize base of support
- Assess postural stability from motion capture data

## Topics Covered

- Postural control fundamentals
- Center of mass (COM) dynamics
- Base of support (BOS) definition and calculation
- COM-BOS relationships
- Stability margins
- Postural sway analysis

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3211 - Kinematics, Joint Angles, and Center of Mass](./3211-kinematics.md)

## Deliverable

*To be specified by instructor*
