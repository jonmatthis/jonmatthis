# 3213 - BOS/COM Data

```{note}
This module involves recording and analyzing your own base of support and center of mass data.
```

## Learning Objectives

- Record motion capture data of yourself performing stability tasks
- Analyze BOS/COM relationships in your own data
- Apply concepts from previous modules to real data

## Prerequisites

- Completed [3212 - Posture, COM, and Base of Support](./3212-posture-com.md)
- Working motion capture setup

## Deliverable

**Recording of similar movement on yourself**

Record and submit motion capture data of yourself performing BOS/COM relevant tasks (e.g., standing balance, weight shifts, reaching tasks).

## Next Steps

Continue to [3214 - Jumping Data](./3214-jumping-data.md).
