PREVIOUS DRAFT (FROM MY POST DOC DAYS): 

My primary research goal is to understand the guiding principles and neural bases the stability and grace of human movement. In particular, I seek to understand the way that the human central nervous system integrates information from the sensory systems in order to generate stable and precise actions to achieve goals and move through the world. In my early graduate years, I worked with my advisor Brett Fajen in the Perception and Action lab at RPI to study the way that humans use visual information to select actions when moving through a complex environment. For my dissertation work, I developed a novel experimental apparatus that used an Augmented Reality groundplane in order to study the visual control of foot placement when walking over complex terrain (The work described in Aims 1 and 2 is an advancement of this methodology and line of research).  A core features of my research is to use the basic biomechanics of bipedal gait as the starting point to the study of the visual control of foot placement. In my post-doctoral work, I began study of the visual control of walking in natural environments, which offers many new insights that could not be gained from studying locomotion in a constrained laboratory setting. By leveraging emerging technologies such as mobile eye trackers and IMU based motion capture, I was able to accurately record walkers’ 3D gaze and full-body kinematics as they walked over unconstrained real-world terrain. As Northeastern, I will continue to use new technology to record quantified measurements of human performance in natural settings, as well as performing controlled lab-based experiments to test hypotheses derived from the real-world observational studies.

# **2\. Gaze and the control of foot placement during locomotion over real-world rough terrain.** My post-doctoral work examines the gaze allocation strategies that support locomotion over real world rough terrain environments. This research advances the field by adding insight into the control of locomotion in natural environments to existing approaches that rely on simplified lab-based environments. Early results suggest that this project will substantially alter our current understanding of the visual control of human locomotion.

**3\. The role of biomechanics in the visual control of foot placement.** My doctoral work examined the way that the biomechanics and physical dynamics of bipedal gait shape the visual control streatgies that are used to guide foot placement during locomotion over complex terrain. Drawing on the theoretical framework afforded by the passive dynamic perspective on human gait, I discovered that there is a critical phase in the human gait cycle for the visual control of foot placement. These results have resulted in several publications in high impact journals (see below), and have been cited in publications from researchers in a diverse variety of fields, such as perceptual psychophysics, clinical and theoretical biomechanics, robotic control systems, and comparative biology.

**4\.  Visual Control Strategies for foot placement in robotic bipedal locomotion.** In addition to my contributions to the field of sensorimotor neuroscience and psychology, my research also has direct applications to the field of legged robotics. Current approaches to the control of legged robots rely on extremely fast feedback loops, but are generally lacking in feed forward “vision-like” control. My work identifying the visual control strategies that humans use to guide foot placement in rough terrain has been inspired the development of novel control systems for bipedal robots. My collaboration with robotics researchers has been fostered through invited talks (a-c, below) and in a joint poster at the 2016 Dynamic Walking conference (d, below).

**5\.  Visual and Non-visual contributions to estimations of locomotor capabilities.** In my early graduate career, I worked on a research project that examined the role of visual and non-visual information about self-motion to actor’s estimations of their own locomotor capabilities. This project extended upon the “flow parsing” hypothesis to the identification of independently moving objects during self-motion by showing that non-visual information about self-motion contributes to actors perception about the movement of objects in their environment.
