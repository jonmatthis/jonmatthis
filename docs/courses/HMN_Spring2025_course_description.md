Topic: Neural control of human movement 

Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g. sports, dance, or everyday activities) by investigating biomechanics and neuroscience of human movement, with a focus on the interactions between the perecptual and motor systems in the context of natural tasks and behavior. 

The goal of this class is to introduce students this broadly cross-dicplinarly field, utilizing a combination of traditional and AI-based methods to navigate the diverse literature and sub-disciplines associated with the neural bases of real-world human movement.

The course will cover philosophical, technological, and scientific aspects related to the study of the neural bases of natural behavior. Students will gain exposure to various methods for recording human movement in natural environemnts (including motion capture, eye tracking, and electromyography) as well as methods for analyzing and visualizing the resulting data to develop scientific insight into the neural underpinnings of the recorded behavior. Programming experience is not required, but interested students will also have the opportunity to gain exposure to Python-based analysis of human movement data
