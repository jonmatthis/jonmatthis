## YYY-MM-DD
###### tags: `2022-summer-checkin` `template`

### Things Done in the past 6 months
- literally
- just
- list
- things
- as
- you
- think
- of 
- them

### Things you're most proud of
- Ask them which on the previous list they are most proud of
- Ask them Why, and note - 
    - what part of it was satisfying?
        - topic was interesting?
        - skills involved?
        - enjoyed the challenge?
        - liked that other people liked it?
    - How is this person motivated?
        - Questions - scientist-type
        - Hard problems - enigneer-type
        - Helping people - clinical-type
        - Presenting work - communicator-type
        - etc
    - Do they have too much, or not enough confidence?
        - ESPECIALLY - Are they able to say good things about their own work? 
        

### Things you want to work on 
- skills they want to get better at
    - give them tasks with that thing in it. 
    - encourage pairing them with other person in lab with that XP (and then actively push this to happen, because they won't do it on their own)
- things they want to know more about
    - 'assign' lit review, recommend papers, etc
- etc

### PLANS - Next 6 months
- Ideally these are 'S.M.A.R.T.' style goals, i.e. things that would fall under the 'milestones' category in the Github Project Managament whosit
    - but I think vagueness is fine here to keep things moving. You can nail things down later
    - or also things like 
- Probably like 2-3 achievable goals, ideally in different areas

### PLANS - Next 1 year 
- these are the things that would be available if the things in the `next 6 months` secion work out.
    - Like, if you make the experiment and get all the data, then you'll be able to submit the paper, etc
- Still fairly specific

### PLANS - Next 2 years
- Getting less specific here. 
- Kinda imagining different possible futures, depending on how things go with `6-month` and `1-year` plans

### PLANS - Next 5 years
- Getting way more generic here
- this is usually thinking about the purpose of 'this phase' of life
    - usually this is like, "You'll recently graduated or about to graduate, etc"
- Starting to learn more about the "why are you doing this" side of things
- getting more info about their values and whatnot
- talking more about differnt potential future trajectories and whatnot

### PLANS - Next 10 years
- just to freak 'em out a bit lol
- this is basically just daydreaming
