# SkellyBot - A heirarchically prompted, Discord-based AI teaching assistant for higher education

## Description
For the past 5 semesters (since Summer '23), I have been developing Skellybot to assist me in teaching high level university courses (specifically on the topic of my domain of research - the perceptuomotor neuroscience of human movement) 

The bot itself is relatively basic (AI-wise), but represents an incredibly powerful teaching tool, which has massively elevated my ability to teach high level complex explorations of deep-science topics to University undergrads in both online and in-person contexts. 

Skellybot utilizes a novel Hierarchical Prompting approach where the prompt schema mirrors the structure of a Discord server, which is organized according to the topics of the course. 

Over the past 2.5 years, I have jointly honed and iterated on the technical infrastructure of this bot alongside the development of new teaching strategies organized around the nascent, transformative of AI-mediated natural language processing to provide students with an unprecedented level of individualized instruction with large-scale student-data analysis pipelines. 

##  Why do you think this would be a good talk for this audience? - required 

This project has been transformative to my personal approach to and philosophy of teaching. I believe it will represent an interesting, real-world vetted example of AI-education technology that the AI Tinkerers of Boston would find interesting and enticing.
