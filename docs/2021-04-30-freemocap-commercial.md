need mention:
 community involvement (ajz, Vandlo, etc)
tie ins to animation game dev (both in terms of educational bridges, as well as openning door for gamification workflows, involving AI)
SkellyBot as predicate for future AI/LLM integration

Commercialization 
Principles

Knowledge is Free, Labor is unbelievably expensive 

all educational content is free forever, anything involving human labor costs (relative to the XP and skillset of the laborer)
No artificial scarcity

anything that can be duplicated infinitely is free, otherwise costs

Flexible pricing 

transparency re: base costs and margins

let people pick a price (humble bundle model - peeps tend to pick slightly higher than rec if they like the cause) 

asking below breakeven requires application, costs handled by ‘community grant fund’ (a category folks can pay into)

SkellyCloud services (offsite data storage and backup, serverside processing)

building/selling hardware (cameras, equipment bundles, start via dropshipping cams of different quality, later build our own bespoke for different customer segments, i.e. minimal cost, edu focused, high end clinical/animation, 
in-home easy setup)

Technical certification w/ franchise-ish model (work with PT’s, universities, etc, train people in freemocap (i.e. ai, ml, cv, etc, as well as clinical/biomech/neuro, as well as 3d data viz/mocap art) 

peeps can take their skills and run, or be part of a skellynetwork that will help them find clients, in exchange for a % fee

Service model (we do it ourselves, and we train others to via tech cert above):

building bespoke pipelines

consultation/planning

one-shot help vs continuous service contract
