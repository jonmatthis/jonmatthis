# Personal Statement

My primary research goal is to understand the guiding principles and
neural bases the stability and grace of human movement. In particular, I
seek to understand the way that the human central nervous system
integrates information from the sensory systems in order to generate
stable and precise actions to achieve goals and move through the world.
In my early graduate years, I worked with my advisor Brett Fajen in the
Perception and Action lab at RPI to study the way that humans use visual
information to select actions when moving through a complex environment.
For my dissertation work, I developed a novel experimental apparatus
that used an Augmented Reality groundplane in order to study the visual
control of foot placement when walking over complex terrain (The work
described in Aims 1 and 2 is an advancement of this methodology and line
of research). A core features of my research is to use the basic
biomechanics of bipedal gait as the starting point to the study of the
visual control of foot placement. In my post-doctoral work, I began
study of the visual control of walking in natural environments, which
offers many new insights that could not be gained from studying
locomotion in a constrained laboratory setting. By leveraging emerging
technologies such as mobile eye trackers and IMU based motion capture, I
was able to accurately record walkers' 3D gaze and full-body kinematics
as they walked over unconstrained real-world terrain. As Northeastern, I
will continue to use new technology to record quantified measurements of
human performance in natural settings, as well as performing controlled
lab-based experiments to test hypotheses derived from the real-world
observational studies.

# 1. [Gaze and the control of foot placement during locomotion over real-world rough terrain.]{.underline} My post-doctoral work examines the gaze allocation strategies that support locomotion over real world rough terrain environments. This research is advances the field by adding insight into the control of locomotion in natural environments to existing approaches that rely on simplified lab-based environments. Early results suggest that this project will substantially alter our current understanding of the visual control of human locomotion.  {#gaze-and-the-control-of-foot-placement-during-locomotion-over-real-world-rough-terrain.-my-post-doctoral-work-examines-the-gaze-allocation-strategies-that-support-locomotion-over-real-world-rough-terrain-environments.-this-research-is-advances-the-field-by-adding-insight-into-the-control-of-locomotion-in-natural-environments-to-existing-approaches-that-rely-on-simplified-lab-based-environments.-early-results-suggest-that-this-project-will-substantially-alter-our-current-understanding-of-the-visual-control-of-human-locomotion. .unnumbered}

**2. [The role of biomechanics in the visual control of foot placement.
]{.underline}**My doctoral work examined the way that the biomechanics
and physical dynamics of bipedal gait shape the visual control
streatgies that are used to guide foot placement during locomotion over
complex terrain. Drawing on the theoretical framework afforded by the
passive dynamic perspective on human gait, I discovered that there is a
critical phase in the human gait cycle for the visual control of foot
placement. These results have resulted in several publications in high
impact journals (see below), and have been cited in publications from
researchers in a diverse variety of fields, such as perceptual
psychophysics, clinical and theoretical biomechanics, robotic control
systems, and comparative biology.

**3. [Visual Control Strategies for foot placement in robotic bipedal
locomotion. ]{.underline}**In addition to my contributions to the field
of sensorimotor neuroscience and psychology, my research also has direct
applications to the field of legged robotics. Current approaches to the
control of legged robots rely on extremely fast feedback loops, but are
generally lacking in feed forward "vision-like" control. My work
identifying the visual control strategies that humans use to guide foot
placement in rough terrain has been inspired the development of novel
control systems for bipedal robots. My collaboration with robotics
researchers has been fostered through invited talks (a-c, below) and in
a joint poster at the 2016 Dynamic Walking conference (d, below).

**4. [Visual and Non-visual contributions to estimations of locomotor
capabilities. ]{.underline}**In my early graduate career, I worked on a
research project that examined the role of visual and non-visual
information about self-motion to actor's estimations of their own
locomotor capabilities. This project extended upon the "flow parsing"
hypothesis to the identification of independently moving objects during
self-motion by showing that non-visual information about self-motion
contributes to actors perception about the movement of objects in their
environment.

**5. [Public communication of science -- Full body biomechanics in the
control of human movement.]{.underline}** Every researcher has a
responsibility to communicate their scientific findings and intuitions
to the general public. To this end, in my spare time I create short
animations that highlight basic biomechanical principles that are
highlighted in the actions of highly skilled athletes. In their various
forms, these animations have gathered over 10 million estimated views,
and been incorporated into the curricula and training plans of multiple
high school teachers and coaches. They will also be highlighted in the
2017 National Biomechanics Day presentation, which is an outreach
program aimed at high school students and teachers. In addition, my
research has been featured in two science-themed online magazines
