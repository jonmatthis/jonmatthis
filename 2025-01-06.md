the total estimated  cost of attendance for 1 year for 1 student at a university which shall we say for legal reasons is similar to the one I teach at, is $90,250. For one year. For one student. 

And in about 6 hours, I will be standing in front of a room of 32 18-year-olds who collectively represent $2.8M in tuition room and board.

Teaching a class which by credit hours alone is valued at $256,000 

What could I possibly say?

Hey kids, here's what neuroscience is, here's how your brain works. Here's what biomechanics is, check out these robots. Isn't that cool? 

Don't worry about the context! Don't worry about the situation at large! And for the love of god, don't worry about the DEBT

Education is a virtue! Science will save us! 

Universities  aren't perfect, but they're what we've got. 

Sure there's problems =, but what're you gonna do? 

But for real though, what re you going to do? 

whata re you going to do?
