# 2024-03-24 CI Boston Palestine 

## Hook
- My name is JSM I am Syrian American and I have been banned from CIB - here's what happened

## Body 
### Prelude
- Past 6 months been a living nightmare
- Realized I felt unsafe in this community
  - bc I know there are people who support or at very least hold space for the ongoing genocide
  - So i decided to say something to the group about it
### The event at the Jam 
- Came to jam with intention of saying something in closing circle
- Midway, I was approached by one of the main facillitators
- Asked how i was doing
- I said "Not great because as an arab american I feel unsafe in this space because I know there are people here who support the ongoing genocide"
- And without missing a beat and with a condescending smile on his face, he said "Well, I bet there are a lot of Israeli people who feel unsafe too"
  - ...which -  of course - is precisely what I was talking about
- Later, at the very end of closing circle, I said: 
  - "As an Arab American, I do not feel safe in this community bc I know that there are people here who have internalized the belief that somehow Palestinian lives are worth less than others"
  - And then I recounted the way that I had shared this with the facillitator and his response was to immediately both-sided the genocide
  - And when I did so, I use "Foul Language"
    - At which point, I was interrupted, becaue of course, the problematic part of that story was when I said the Mean F word to the sweet old man who had just advocated for genocide
  - So I was interruped, but I was not willing to be interrupted 
  - So I raised my vioce, and was interupted again, so i raised my voice again, and I kept raising my voice until I stopped being interrupted, and I was able to say, what I needed to say, which was
    - "there are not two sides- to a fucking genocide"
### The after math
- Over the next few days, various organizers reached out to me wtih all the classic gaslighting
  - Focusing on care and concern for me and my well being, while of course ignoring the *content* of *why* I felt unsafe
  - Plenty of offers to have conversations about what I might need to feel safe. What middle ground could we find 

## Call to Action
- If you are jewish and you are experiencing cognitive dissonance between what you have been raised to believe and what you are seeing with your own eyes, I cannot recommend the documentary `Israelism` strongly enough
- If you are an anti-zionist jewish person - I love you dearly with all my heart. This is your job. Find your voice, and have the conversations that need to be had.

- I give all my love with all my heart to each of you who have earned it
- I will not be back, but I will be around
- We can build something better
- Keep your eyes open 

- Free Palestine
