# Chinese Pole Set up

## 1. Get the stuff
- Poles (2 people per pole)
- Plywood base plants 
- Ratchet straps

### 2. Prepare Poles for lifting 
- Let down pulley points 
- Attach carabiners to empty rings on pole 
- Raise pulley points a few feet
- unwind cables
- attach short cable to other pole
- Lay out ratchet straps -  hook to sink and lobby tie-down ropes (ratchet side towards wall)
- Hook sink and lobby cables from poles to ratchet strap hooks 

 
### 3. Raise poles
- Raise pulley points (2 people with permission to use pulleys) 
- Walk pole feet to plywood (2 people per pole)
- Hook ratchet straps to pulley point cleats and pulley point cables to straps 
- Tighten straps partly
- Plumb poles (one person straightens, another directs when it is upright)
- Tighten straps

## Things to keep in mind:

- some steps work better in different orders with different numbers of people.  for example, I'd rather to the short cable before lifting the poles at all, but it has to be unwound first, so it matters whether there's someone to lift the pole

- something I suspect work better in different orders if everyone knows the drill, vs if someone is giving instructions and people are trying to parse them

- lots of early setup can be done simultaneously if multiple people know what to do
