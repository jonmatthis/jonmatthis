things to keep in mind:
Jen
some steps work better in different orders with different numbers of people.  for example, I'd rather to the short cable before lifting the poles at all, but it has to be unwound first, so it matters whether there's someone to lift the pole
Jen
something I suspect work better in different orders if everyone knows the drill, vs if someone is giving instructions and people are trying to parse them
Jen
lots of early setup can be done simultaneously if multiple people know what to do
Jen
a few things I can do while kids are still having class
Jen
ok, I think I remembered all the steps, but you're welcome to check the list against what happens this week ðŸ™‚
