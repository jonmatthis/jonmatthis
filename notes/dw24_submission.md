Submissions
Submit your topic by March 15th 22nd!

We will accept talk topic submissions until March 15 22, 2024 for the upcoming Dynamic Walking Conference. A one-minute (maximum) video is required with your submission. These videos will be made available to other Dynamic Walking submitters for review. Think about the following topics when creating your talk topic and video:

    How can we predict how people or animals will move from basic principles?

    How can we build more-stable, more versatile and more-energy-effective legged robots?

    How do we determine success or usefulness with wearable robotic devices?

    What data do we have that reveals or refutes important principles or concepts in animal, human or robotic legged locomotion?

Central topics of the conference will include: energetics, stability, predictive principles and models, dynamic modeling, empirical data with a conceptual tie in, robot and prosthetics successes and failures.

Less emphasis on: vision, navigation, motion planning, kinematic data, kinematic control, measurements that do not address a basic concept or principle.

Note that there will be a variety of 20 minute, 15 minute, 10 minute, 5 minute, and 1 minute lightning talks. All attendees will be required to speak or present posters. There will also be multiple hardware demonstration sessions and posters will be on display throughout the conference.  

Don't have anything technical to talk about? You are welcome to join us, but know that all attendees will be speakers or presenters. You will be required to do 1-minute presentation at the conference describing who you are, your research interests, and what you hope to learn at the conference (or you could present a problem, instead of a solution). You will also need to complete the form below (including the one-minute video part) to get your name on the attendee list.

Submissions deadline: March 15, 2024 March 22, 2024

Acceptance notification: March 29, 2024 April 3, 2024
